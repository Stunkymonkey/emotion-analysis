 1 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;My quality of life went waaaaaaaaay up. I eat breakfast like every day now. I eat less fast food because making food for two people is easier than one. I actually *go* to bed rather than fall asleep.
 2 ;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;I stopped being able to hide things. When I lived alone, I would do my classwork late at night and be messy and have disordered eating or hours-long crying spells or whatever but I was able to keep any of that negative stuff away from my relationship. When he could see me all the time, though, I was forced to be a lot more honest about problems / areas for improvement in my life and I had to actually fix them. I can't present as ideal an image of myself anymore, but the person I actually am has improved.
 3 ;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;If found it's harder to be apart for long periods of time after you've lived with your SO and home no longer feels like home without them there. It's really enjoyable but it's also difficult if you just want a second to yourself.
 4 ;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;Hair. Hair everywhere.
 5 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;We have tons more money.
 6 ;1;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;"I remember the first time I tripped over her shoes at my place, it was adorable. A real ""I'm not alone,"" warm and fuzzy feeling. 
 
 That's gone. She's just a slob now."
 7 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;I have more computer components all over my house, he has more cats.
 8 ;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;"I had to face the fact that I had way too many clothes and got rid of a lot. That was the biggest change for me.
 
 There was one night shortly after moving in together that he went out with friends and didn't come home until 7:30 in the morning. I was mostly panicking because he'd left on his motorcycle, and I hadn't heard from him since about 1 am. His phone had died. After that incident, he never went out to drink on the motorcycle, and never stayed out that late without telling me again.
 
 EDIT: Threw a space in for clarity; the late night drinking and the clothes are two separate things that changed."
 9 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;"Someone might jump out at you naked in the dark. And you might drop to a knee and punch straight into a pair of testicles.
 
 Someone may still be mad at you about said incident 5 years later."
 10 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;Household toilet paper usage increased by 70,000%
 11 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"My apartment is messier but better decorated now.
 
 When I lived alone, my apartment was always spotless. No dirty dishes, no clothes sitting around, garbage cans empty, all floors swept or vacuumed, mopped if necessary, and everything stayed in its proper place.
 
 Girlfriend moves in, and messes accumulate everywhere. The weird thing is that it's not just her messes. I'm making messes and leaving them everywhere, too. How do I get the old me back? And don't tell me I need to delete facebook, go to the gym, and block all communication, bro."
 12 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;"I had to start being more clean and respecting how she wanted our place to look. I didn't ever realize how particular she was until then and it caused more than a few arguments.
 
 We finally worked it out and we keep it more in the middle now, which is doable for us both.
 
 This experience was a HUGE proponent before why I think people should live with their SOs for at least a year before marriage/kids. You can love someone and not be able to live with them."
 13 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;"My cabinet doors are almost always left open now. I'm so used to seeing it at this point that I don't actually see it, and occasionally ram my face into one when cooking or cleaning.
 
 It's really not hard, guys. Close the damn cabinets."
 14 ;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;"We both think more about how to arrange things for each other's physical bodies, I think. He's 6'2"" and left-handed, I'm 5'6"" and right-handed. Some commonly used stuff got moved to lower cabinets and I immediately bought a step ladder. He puts the knives facing the other direction in the dish drainer so I don't knock them with my elbow. I don't hang bigger pots on the hook on our pot rack where he's likely to knock his head."
 15 ;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;"Falling asleep without them gets harder and harder as the years go by. We're living in different states right now and my sleep ritual takes hours. 
 
 One would think I'd enjoy not having his excessively loud snoring."
 16 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"When I moved in with my wife, then girlfriend, we only had one bowl to our name. We took turns eating cereal for breakfast. 
 
 After I managed to trip over a cord we were also down to one lamp. We moved it around the apartment as needed. 
 
 It definitely showed me I didn't need things to be happy so long as I had her."
 17 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;When your SO moves in, you'll pick a side of the bed to sleep on. Pick wisely, this is now your side for the next 30 years.
 18 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;"My girlfriend likes waking up between 8-9 on Weekends. I stopped sleeping in until 1 when I learned that she'd get up, have coffee, do a small workout, play fucking 3 hours of Don't Starve, eat lunch, and then try waking my ass up.
 
 Used to be a night owl, started appreciating getting up earlier, and having a slower pace start to the day with all that extra time. Can lounge around in my boxers drinking coffee petting my cat for 2 hours if I want. Better than being up at 1, bed head, and have to be somewhere 20 minutes later, forgetting to put on deodorant, forget my bus pass, running around, scrambling, no coffee, skipped breakfast."
 19 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;"ironically the amount of time we spend together.
 
 when we lived apart, we'd go over each other's houses 6 nights/week and pretty much do *nothing* but spend time together.
 
 now that we live together, we greet each other after getting home from work, spend a couple hours in separate rooms doing our own thing (me: gaming; him: surfing Facebook/watching tv) before having dinner together and watching tv together on the couch for an hour or two."
 20 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"My house decluttered, fast.
 
 I was never dirty or anything, but I was pretty lazy/messy over certain things. Like I would never leave dishes that had to be hand washed piled in the sink, but I would put off emptying my dishwasher, I would fold my clothes before I dragged them up from my buildings basement laundry room, but they'd end up staying folded in the basket instead of putting them away, stuff like that. Once we moved in together that pretty much stopped, because it was either something he would just do anyway or sharing a not that big space with someone else meant that it didn't make sense to take up room like that.
 
 Also I got rid of a ton of stuff I didn't need, because I'm a packrat and he has no tolerance for that shit and will just throw it away if he knows we for sure don't need it. Nine times out of ten I'll forget we even had it."
 21 ;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;Having him as my only roommate means we are naked all. The. Time.
 22 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"I've always been the kind of person that sleeps in total darkness and silence. He has always left the tv in his bedroom on all night.
 
 Now we set a timer on the tv for an hour when we go to bed. 
 
 Obviously I'd rather just turn it off (and sometimes I sneakily set the timer for 30 min) but I love him and I do it because he needs it to fall asleep."
 23 ;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;"Well the arguments pretty much stopped. When we lived apart, we would bicker about the nonsensical stuff. Now it's only big topics we get in a quip about but even then shit blows over much quicker.
 
 I mostly learned how to live comfortably with someone and not just awkward tip-toeing like with roommates. It's also way easier to plan days or evenings out."
 24 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;"How fast food is eaten. It's the one thing I never would have expected or even considered. 
 
 For example, before when I lived alone I could order a pizza and have leftovers for at least two more days. Or a big pot of chili would last a week. Now it's pretty rare to have more than two slices of pizza leftover for the next day, or if I'm still eating chili 3 days after I made it that's something to be excited about. And god forbid he finishes the leftovers you've been looking forward to all day."
 25 ;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;"I used to be able to leave my bf, go home, hang out alone at home, watch tv, go to bed, read. 
 
 We recently got married, but lived together for 5 years now, i can't stand coming home and not having him there to talk to. I love the company. 
 
  Don't get me wrong, i cherish my alone time, but nothing is better than coming home to him, sitting on the couch with our new baby, and just talking about our day. He plays his xbox, me and the babe play in her play pen in the living room, and we just talk. It's the best. 
 
 Having someone to share everything with is amazing, no judgements, you don't have to try hard, you can talk about anything, but just having someone there, always, it's a great feeling."
 26 ;0;1;0;0;0;1;1;0;"The biggest was how much of a slob she was. I am certainly not the bastion of cleanness or organization, but her concept of putting something away was to let go of it. It was almost like magic, the second that she let go of something it didn't exist anymore. It was almost like a child like approach to object permanence. 
 
 It stayed this way for our 25 years of marriage.
 
 I tried everything. I tried punishment, reward, shame, taking small steps, getting her mom involved, whatever… It never stuck. She never complained about the mess, to her credit, and always seemed extremely and openly appreciative towards all my efforts of cleaning. And considering she was far better at other skills in the marriage, like people organization, management, strong-arm needs, school stuff, legal paperwork, and other stuff that I didn't have a head for, she took care of. So while our marriage was never 50-50, it evened out that way. She just really sucked at cleaning. I really sucked it going to a school office and giving somebody a piece of my mind because they fucked up my son's medical paperwork yet again. You play on your strengths, you know?
 
 Any flat space became prime real estate in our house. Tables, chairs, counterspace, floors, things on top of floors like coffee tables or just a box that had been left there for too long, became covered with whatever. And it wasn't so much an organic mess, but just paperwork and boxes and clothing and ... *things.*
 
 When she passed away, it took about a year and a half to fully clean out every space that she had occupied for any steady period of time. Her former home-office, for instance, which became kind of a catchall ground for, ""I don't know where this goes, let's put it in her old office,"" took the longest. It took about three people about a year and a half to finally get everything down to the carpeting in the walls, and it was repurposed into a new guestroom.
 
 When we got married I was 20 years old. When she passed away I was 45. That is a huge significant span of time and mental growth periods to cover. I didn't regret any of the 25 years that I was married to her, and I miss her very much. The only Pyrrhic victory I could claim over outlasting her, is that my dining room table has remained clutter free during the last three years."
 27 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;Moved straight from a college dorm into a nice apartment with my boyfriend. Honestly everything is basically the same except that I now have access to a full kitchen and so I'm eating a lot healthier. Also he saves money not having to drive an hour to see me. Living together is awesome.
 28 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;Why is everyone on Reddit the more clean, considerate, and responsible one in a relationship or group of friends? After moving in with my gf, I realized I'm a slob who doesn't clean up after himself at all.
 29 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;The fact that you BOTH have annoying habits...
 30 ;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;"Talking more. Also getting more comfortable being in a room together but not talking. It sounds contradictory but it makes sense in person. 
 
 The sex is less ""hot"" I guess because it's not so sporadic, but it's more consistent and youre very comfortable with eachother. 
 
 Not really a ""change"" I guess but you become much more aware of eachothers body stuff. How often they shower and brush their teeth. What they do with their hair every day. How much hair they shed every day. Their rashes and bumps and random bruises. It can feel a little TOO intimate sometimes but whatever. 
 
 I like it better this way."
 31 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"The way we organize our books. He likes them to be organized by topic or use, then grouped into subgroups and arranged alphabetically. 
 
 I like things to be arranged by topic, then arranged visually on the shelf so that they're grouped by size and the largest books are near the outside of the shelf (on both ends) moving inward to the smallest. And the heaviest books all have to be on the bottom shelf."
 32 ;1;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;"I wake up multiple times throughout the night and will roll over and kiss his shoulder/head and make sure I'm not hogging the covers, while before us living together I couldn't even share my bed with my beagle without thinking he's taking up the whole bed. 
 Feels good to love"
 33 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;We have about the same amount of sex, but it's more consistent. Like, if we only saw each other once or twice a week we'd have sex 3-4 times. Now we have sex everyday or every other day, but almost never have it three times in one day.
 34 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;"I realized that as much as I hate cleaning up after myself, I hate cleaning up for another grown-ass adult even more.
 
 We lived together for 3.5 years until I moved out last year. We're still together, just don't live together. It's far better this way. If we move out of our city, we might try living together in a different kind of space, but a cramped apartment was a nightmare."
 35 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;My house. I lived here 6 years and never moved anything. I knew where everything was. My wife moves shit around all the time.
 36 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"I really had to cut down on the gaming... like... drastically. 
 
 I didn't really go out much except maybe once every other week since drinking is so expensive, and I don't watch tv, so when I wasn't working or in school I would be gaming. Period. That's been my hobby for years. I would spend hours every evening like it was nothing. 
 
 Yeah, turns out that makes a woman feel hopelessly neglected and alone after a bit. Sacrifices were made. It was a huge point of contention for a while, but we are much happier now."
 37 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;Socks. Socks everywhere. Where do they come from where do they go?
 38 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;I've now seen more anime than I ever intended or wanted.
 39 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"My fiance and I lived together our senior year of college, and then had a long distance relationship for a year while he worked in California and I worked in Colorado. After his contract lapsed in California, he moved out to Colorado and moved in with me. I will comment on my experience of having him move in with me.
 
 The main change that I did not expect was my life became far more structured when we moved in together. I used to frequently work well into the evening and then figure out my dinner plan on the way home. I used to whip up my meal and then eat it while standing at the counter or walking around doing things. Now we have a set dinner plan every night, and we actually take the time to sit down at the table with each other and have a conversation.
 
 Moving in together is over all a huge net positive. We cut our cost of living in half. We get to spend far more time together. We now have an awesome, adorable dog ([pupper tax](http://imgur.com/PMsnv99).) Life is good. My only complaint is that he is really good at making messes and then just walking away from them. I can leave for work and the kitchen will be spotless, and return home to find stacks of dishes in the sink and crumbs and other gunk covering the counter tops. We are working on the cleanliness issue though. 
 
 Edit: I've been reminding him pretty regularly for the past few months to put his dirty clothing in the hamper instead of throwing it on the ground next to the bed. He seems to have [mastered getting it *near* the hamper](http://imgur.com/I4OlVdi). Hopefully we can move towards getting it actually *in* the hamper soon."
 40 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"We were previously in a LDR so we have less sex now that we lived together than when we were seeing each other every few weeks but that's a given. We argue about the same or slightly less but our arguments are always over something stupid so I think being face to face with each other makes us realize how much we don't want to fight with one another. 
 
 Also, there's much more farting. We never farted around each other and now it's like a constant symphony of farts."
 41 ;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;We stopped spending time together. That sounds weird, but when we lived separately he used to call me up and spend hours talking to me. Now that I see him every evening, it's really difficult to get his focused attention even for five minutes.
 42 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;I wake up at 5:30-6a every day to go run before I have to get ready for work. Since we've moved in together, most mornings when I get back to the apartment he's cooking breakfast and has it timed exactly so that it'll be done when I get out of the shower. Love that man to pieces.
 43 ;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;"We fight way more now. I've always been an independent person and he has always been taken care of by his parents, who he lived with until he was 22. He only lived on his own for a few months before we got a place together- I would have preferred to wait, but other factors kind of demanded I find a roommate and it seemed to make sense at the time.
 
 But he immediately slipped back into the habit of expecting me to care for him like his mother did. So where I am of the idea that I will clean my messes, he will clean his messes, and we split the other chores evenly, he just expects me to take care of my messes and his messes and all of the chores. So I don't, and then he throws fits about the place being a mess and I ask, ""When did you last do the dishes? If you're so upset about the kitchen being a mess, why don't you take an hour to do your dishes?""
 
 But it just turns cyclical. He's say ""Well, one of those dishes is yours."" and I'll say, ""Yes, but I'm not complaining about the mess. And that doesn't change the fact that most of the dishes are yours.""
 
 But it always just falls on me. I don't mind living in clutter, so it turns into so many fights.
 
 It also destroyed our sex life. He has a low sex drive. Living separately meant that our alone time was a treat that took planning, living together just meant that sex was another of his chores. He's happy to spend the 5 minutes getting himself where he needs to be, but if I'm not done by them, sucks to suck, he's got to go play WoW."
 44 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"Having no place to go to be ""alone"". I guess I need a man cave."
 45 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;Fucking fairy lights and candles
 46 ;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;We both got over our boundaries issues very quickly when our first apartment didn't have a door on the master bathroom. When we first started dating I wouldn't even go to the bathroom when I visited. After we moved in together I would be peeing while he was shaving by the sink and we would just have our normal conversations.
 47 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;What a wholesome thread this is really nice, this brightened my day, thanks everybody.
 48 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;The way we did things, like me piling dishes in the sink instead of rinsing them off first. Him, picking up his clothes off of the floor instead of putting them in the laundry. Actually...he still puts his clothes on the floor but I've gotten past it over the years.
 49 ;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;The hair spiders in the shower have become a frightening new normal for me in the past 2 years. It STILL scares me.
 50 ;1;0;1;0;0;1;0;1;"After 3 1/2 years of dating, we were excited! Still had/has issues, but the idea of living together just made us forget about it. After the first couple months, it was great. Loved going home to my beautiful girlfriend, feeling like an adult since it was my first time being on my own without my parents.
 
 Then the ""honey moon phase"" drifted off, and our issues slowly started coming into play, we grew kind of distant and quiet with each other. As well as became annoyed with each other for every small thing. Fights grew bigger and bigger until one day, we both snapped and I moved out and decided I wasn't ready for this. We still loved each other deeply.
 
 I move back into my parents again, after a month of quietness, we talked again over a couple of days, apologized for our actions and understood where we both were coming from and her and I were not ready to move in because of our issues before we moved in.
 
 Fast forward 5 months later, we're increasingly getting better at understanding our needs. No where near perfect, but that's ok. I've bought a computer I've always wanted but couldn't afford, and she understood I've been wanting it for *years*. So now, I'm preparing to move in again, and she is too! Going on 5 years in June!
 
 So to conclude, it hurt our relationship, but opened us up to our underlying issues, we were strong to stay with each other after our issues and still needed each other. Learned a valuable lesson from our mistakes and ready to go forward with our relationship too!"
 51 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;After a long, bad marriage, I got divorced a few years ago and eventually found a great girlfriend. She moved in nine months ago. What changed the most? I'm happy every fucking day. She's amazing and we love being together. She's a bit sloppy in the kitchen -- dirty dishes and spilled food on the cabinets, etc. Who cares? She's worth it, and I'm an extremely lucky person. One good thing about a bad marriage is that you learn what really matters. Don't sweat the little things. See the big picture and appreciate what you have.
 52 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;"Nothing stays clean. 
 
 I could do the laundry, fold it up nice and neat, and she leaves it there for 2 weeks before putting it away. 
 
 Oh, you just put dishes in the dishwasher with room to put more? Here's some dishes I'll put in the sink instead."
 53 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;There is now actual food in the fridge and pantry. Before living together he subsisted on beer, bourbon, cereal, weed, and fast food.
 54 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;My masturbation location
 55 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;We got fat.
 56 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"I recently moved in with my boyfriend of nearly 6 years. We used to be a long distance relationship. With me in Michigan, him in Illinois. We both moved to Texas and now are having a lot more fun. 
 
 I think the biggest change has been that doing simple things like cleaning or laundry or dishes or rearranging... Is a lot more fun. There's someone there with you and honestly, that gets everything done faster. Or slower if you're like my boyfriend and I who get distracted poking and playfully annoying each other all the time. 
 
 It's also strange seeing all your belongings merge together into one area. But the messes from merging belongings is also a real struggle. Twice as much laundry strewn about. And twice as many dishes. But. Entirely worth it."
 57 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"Oh, man, getting used to each other's ""normal"" habits. What's normal for you is guaranteed to be annoying as hell to someone else.
 
 If you are relaxed in your approach to housekeeping and s/he is a neat freak, there's gonna be some issues. 
 
 But there are ways to compromise, and that's the good part about living together - if you recognize that each of you need to go with your strengths to support the other.
 
 For example, I love to cook. I do all the foods. I hate to clean. He does the majority of the cleaning. Laundry bothers me very little until I have to fold it and put it away. I wash and dry, he folds and puts up. I love gardening and outside work, he hates it. I handle the yard, he repairs stuff that breaks. 
 
 He's a TV watcher, I'm a reader. I read while he watches TV. I love to read Reddit, he Facebooks. We both find interesting crap and share it with each other. Many evenings are spent discussing completely useless esoterica we discover. i love metal, blues, techno, world and indie music. He's acoustic, classical and jazz . We alternate music every other night and have learned to appreciate each other's taste.
 
 It took a while to sort out what we did together - as opposed to what we used to do separately. But since we've been doing it for four decades now, I think it's going to work out."
 58 ;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;"The amount of dog hair on EVERYTHING and sharing a bed with a large dog.
 
 I am not a dog person - especially big dogs that shed. My boyfriend has 2 big dogs, one of which is his pride and joy. He sleeps on the bed with us and it's something I'll never be fully comfortable with but I deal. 
 
 The worst thing about it is when I'm trying to sleep and the dog starts licking himself audibly at 4 am. The fuckin worst."
 59 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;"I've been living with my gf a month now. It is a great feeling, I know eventually that the glow will wear off a bit. We're still putting stuff away. Holy hell, how the hell did she fit so much into a studio. We've got a 2 bedroom apt now. 
 
 Id say is where the money goes. I'm giving her a bunch of money for the rent, it's amazing how priorities change."
 60 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"Started cooking
 
 When I lived by myself I would almost never cook. Sometimes I would make a simple pasta and jar of sauce but that was the extent of it. One of my girlfriend's biggest hobbies is trying out new recipes.
 
 Now I cook all the time, three nights a week at the very least. Usually we do it together, sometimes just her, lest seldom just myself but my cabinets have way more utensils, cooking supplies, and spices than I ever did when I lived alone."
 61 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"I saw how he never puts his socks in the hamper. We call them ""Sockie piles"" I don't think that will ever change. it's been 5 years already."
 62 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;She quit trippin on me to come visit all the time.
 63 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;"All of my toys now become the kid's toys as well, ""no get your nasty sticky Popsicle fingers off of my xbox controller"", ""oh they're fine, they can play one of your games"", ""don't touch my comic books, you can't read yours anymore because you've ripped the pages out of them and you're not gonna do that to mine"", ""come on they're just magazines, they aren't gonna hurt them"", ""get the hell away from my tools, I bought you a set and you lost everything but pouch the tools went in within a week"", ""oh stop, they're just trying to help"". Yes those are all valid points, and I'll be more than happy to share all of my hobbies with them AS SOON AS THEY FIGURE OUT HOW NOT TO TEAR SHIT UP! Now how about we let them play around on your laptop sweetheart? Oh you don't want them to? They just want to play games on it. That's exactly what I thought."
 64 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;My (woman) bathroom was never the same again. All kinds of hair everywhere, bits of toothpaste and so many wet towels.
 65 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;"This wasn't something that actually changed, but my perception of its reality changed. 
 
 Back when I first started dating my SO, he and his family were living in temporary close quarters while their house was being rebuilt after a fire. He borrows a lot of clothes from his dad and vice versa (they are the same size and have similar taste). There would be piles of clothes all over his room, and at the time he would tell me ""I'm not putting them away because they belong to my dad, I'm just going to give them back to him soon anyway."" Now he leaves his clothes everywhere and I know that it was ALL a LIE!
 
 Edit: also, the sex. Lots and lots of great, weird sex now that we have our own whole entire house to do it in."
 66 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;It's not always clean like it was when it was just me. He's not a slob but he's definitely a messy guy. I did laundry this morning and found his boxer briefs under the coffee table. I can't get annoyed though as I'm partially to blame for them being there.
 67 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"I met my SO when we were backpacking around Thailand so being young and free spirited I woke up in his bed the next day. And then a few days later again. And then we decided to go to Cambodia together and obviously budget wise we might as well split the cost of a room. And then we just kept going and going until eventually I came back to Canada and brought him with me. 
 
 
 
 
 So I guess what changed the most was that we had to get stupid jobs."
 68 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;She never leaves, SHE NEVER LEAVES.
 69 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;Toilet paper runs out 8 times as fast now.
 70 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;"He needs a fan to sleep. Drives me up the wall, and when I turn it off in the morning I sigh audibly as if my brain could finally relax. Every fucking day.
 
 Also I get to have my best friend lay on my boobies when he's had a rough day. 
 
 Best friend and SO are the same person, for clarification."
 71 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;My one bedroom apartment seems so much smaller now.
 72 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;Honestly, not all that much. I had less time to be alone, that's the biggest one to me.
 73 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;He poops with the door open!
 74 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;For me its really great. We got married recently and the downsides are that you feel the pressure to check in with your SO wherever you go out of respect, so in a way it feels like you lose a lot of freedom. Additionally, your money no longer just affects you but affects your SO as well so you may feel pressured to be more fiscally conservative or feel guilty when you buy things for yourself. Additionally, if your living together you may feel pressured to spend time the majority of your time with each other and stray away from doing independent hobbies. However, the upsides are more openness in the relationship, sleeping together, having someone to divide up household chores with, sharing financial assets, a general sense of happiness if your in a positive relationship, a greater amount of respect from my SO's family.
 75 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;Cuddling all night and getting great sleep isn't always the reality. He's warm and snores like a walrus and talks endless amounts of gibberish in his sleep. We still cuddle before its time to sleep and if we are both exhausted enough to fall asleep instantly but Jesus, sometimes I could smother him to get him to just SHUT THE FUCK UP and stop snoring.
 76 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"Not much changed.
 
 ... Until the fire nation attacked."
 77 ;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;He is a fucking slob who doesn't even shower or brush his nasty fucking teeth
 78 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;I got to spend all of my time with my best friend.
 79 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;All the little everyday happiness. Just a general feeling of belonging. I am very grateful to experience this daily.
 80 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;My SO moved to my home state after a two month LDR, we're currently planning the wedding after about eight months livin together
 81 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;If you only have one bathroom, you will pray to the gods for a day when you two live with two bathrooms.
 82 ;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;My husband and I have lived together for 8 years, but for the past 4 months I haven't been working, and he mostly works from home, sometimes leaving to make sales but he will only be gone about an hour. So we spend ALOT more time together than we ever did before. Its weird. I get so sick of never having any time to myself and pray for some time alone...and then he leaves for a few hours and I almost immediately start to miss him. I'll be watching something and want to talk to him about it. Or be laying in bed watching Netflix and just be sad he isn't there to cuddle with. Its just very comforting having someone that loves you be there all the time.
 83 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;I went from having one Smokey and the Bandit DVD in the house to having two Smokey and the Bandit DVDs in the house.
 84 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"We both were pretty independent and knew how to cook, clean, mend clothes, do laundry and stuff so it was funny trying to split up the work, we both wanted to do it.
 
 Worked things out I'd cook dinners, do the laundry, she would do dishes and clean the place up.
 
 Our first child came around and totally turned things upside down, he would only sleep for 2.5 - 3 hours at a shot before getting hungry and crying.
 
 We had to change up our schedules, I'd stay up till 12 and she would go to bed at 8. When the baby would need feeding/changing I'd take care of him till 12:30-1:00 and then her shift would start.
 
 I worked and she stayed home to care for our son, we really missed each other and when I would get home she would be exhausted and need a nap.
 
 Once he was 3 he started sleeping through the night and we went back to our old schedule, that lasted for 2 years then our next child was born and we had to switch our schedules again."
 85 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"In our relationship? Not much. I'm more aware of when she's pooping then I was when we lived separately. Also she yells at me for getting my beard trimmings on the bathroom vanity but leaves clumps of her shedding hair in the shower drain and her hair straightener and shit like that are always strewn about.
 
 
 
 I tend to leave socks next to the couch :/ but I always clean up the cat puke when that happens. It's all about seeing past the gross things everybody does all the time and still seeing the person you love."
 86 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"We've both become less social. We're both fairly introverted and once we moved in, we always had that one social outlet we needed at home. I work from home so I don't go out with work friends (unless that counts the dog...) and most of my friends either moved away or have their own stuff going on too so I don't feel obligated to spend time away from home. He's basically the same; while he would hang out with friends and relatives a lot before we moved in, now that we've been married for a while he tends to avoid making plans to go out and socialize. 
 
 For introverts it's very comforting but also a dangerous path to hermitage."
 87 ;0;0;0;1;0;0;1;0;She farts so much more. Like. Wow. So much
 88 ;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;"You learn to budget time better. Sometimes you need space, sometimes you need to be together, sometimes your So will want one while you want the other. 
 The important thing is to make an effort. You don't always have to be the one making the effort but you can't expect them to either. Do the dishes some nights while they sit on the couch and relax, but expect them to do the same for you. If you are playing Skyrim for 9 hours and expect them to be ready to hang out as soon as you are done then you can't be mad when she does the same to you. And if you are ever having a disagreement about this, you need to talk about it. You are going to be around each other a hell of a lot more than you are going to be away from each other so don't let things bubble up. Lastly, having a good yelling match every now and then can be healthy, just make sure when you realize it's happening you try and wind it down. 
 
 Take it slow, give each other a lot of chances, and don't expect your relationship to be like anyone elses. It's your relationship and it's never going to be like anything else in the world. 
 
 PS. NEVER! EVRR! TELL THE OTHER PERSON ""If you don't like it, then just leave!"" They are just as much a part of that household as you are once you move in together."
 89 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;"He hates my cooking. I get it, before when he'd ask me to bring him dinner at work, I'd actually put some effort into it. Guess what, bud, we live together, and while I will put effort into weekend dinners and special occasions, I am every now and then going to make spaghetti or DiGiornio. Deal with it. That's what annoys him. 
 
 I am annoyed by the fact that the moment I moved in, it became my job to do ALL the housewifey shit. He used to do his own laundry, wash at least his dishes, clean up after himself, and overnight, all that shit became my responsibility. I don't mind that too much, but it would have been nice to discuss it beforehand, just, hey, ""Since I'm working more now and we are sharing the house, do you mind taking up my slack?""
 
 On the other hand, he is a much more involved co-parent than I expected. I didn't see him being the type that would come home after a 12 hour day and send me to bed for the next four hours. I don't think he expected me to be the kind of person I really am. I think he moved me in expecting to catch me in a lie, that I would be talking to a bunch of different guys or constntly asking him for money, and I turned out to be exactly what I billed myself as being."
 90 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;Toothpaste! Who in the fuck squeezes from the middle? Every time I would brush my teeth I would curse her, while gently coaxing the toothpaste from the bottom like a sane person. Best thing happened when we moved into a house with double vanity and drawers. Advice to couples newly living together: buy two toothpastes if you live with a savage.
 91 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;"I found out just how dirty yet organized he really was. He has a little OCD in the sense that everything has it's place, but he doesn't dust or vacuum or clean the litter box. 
 
 He found out how messy yet clean I was. I leave clothes out or random things all over but I need to have clean floors/counters/bathroom/etc.
 
 It works though! He organizes and picks up after me and I clean everything."
 92 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;"I always used to sleep on the left side of the bed. Now, I'm on the right.
 
 The change took getting used to, but now we both sleep well and I actually kind of like it."
 93 ;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;The feeling of being alone when he goes out of town hurts more than it did when I lived at my parents
 94 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;Before we lived together, if I was pissed off and texted him, he wouldn't read it in my pissed off tone of voice. IRL pissed off me is very clearly pissed off and it takes conversations down a very different route.
 95 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;If your asking what changed with our relationship, us becoming closer is surely one of the results. At first I really enjoyed sharing a bed every night. But that quickly went away when it got hot or I want more space for my arms/legs. I didn't really see any different sides to him while constantly being around him, maybe the occasional mood swing more often then not. However its been a positive experience for me.
 96 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;So when your not living together you spend all your time together in the same room. When you move in with you SO you can finally do your own thing. It was kind of liberating.
 97 ;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;"My SO cannot stick to a schedule even if his life depended on it. As a single mom, I had a VERY strict schedule. All the way down to when I showered, my ""me"" time, everything was meticulously timed. Him moving in shook my world and for some reason, I love it. I was/am extremely OCD, and he helped me push my own boundaries, get professional help, and I am so much happier."
 98 ;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;The amount we care what we look like in front of each other. No make up or fixing up the hair. Too full? Go ahead and pop that shirt off and let that sucker breathe. Pretty relaxing
 99 ;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;How my living space was decorated, no more tacky posters.
 100 ;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;We had been together for a while and spent many nights together, but I didn't understand the degree to which he snored. He isn't overweight and he will snore in any. fucking. position. Even on his stomach!
