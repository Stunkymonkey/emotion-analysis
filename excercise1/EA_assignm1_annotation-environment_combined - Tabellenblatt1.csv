 Used to be a night owl, started appreciating getting up earlier, and having a slower pace start to the day with all that extra time. Can lounge around in my boxers drinking coffee petting my cat for 2 hours if I want.

Once we moved in together that pretty much stopped, because it was either something he would just do anyway or sharing a not that big space with someone else meant that it didn't make sense to take up room like that.
 
 Also I got rid of a ton of stuff I didn't need, because I'm a packrat and he has no tolerance for that shit and will just throw it away if he knows we for sure don't need it. Nine times out of ten I'll forget we even had it."

I am certainly not the bastion of cleanness or organization, but her concept of putting something away was to let go of it. It was almost like magic, the second that she let go of something it didn't exist anymore. It was almost like a child like approach to object permanence. 
 
 It stayed this way for our 25 years of marriage.
 
 I tried everything. I tried punishment, reward, shame, taking small steps, getting her mom involved, whatever… It never stuck. She never complained about the mess, to her credit, and always seemed extremely and openly appreciative towards all my efforts of cleaning. And considering she was far better at other skills in the marriage, like people organization, management, strong-arm needs, school stuff, legal paperwork, and other stuff that I didn't have a head for, she took care of. So while our marriage was never 50-50, it evened out that way. She just really sucked at cleaning. I really sucked it going to a school office and giving somebody a piece of my mind because they fucked up my son's medical paperwork yet again. You play on your strengths, you know?
 
 Any flat space became prime real estate in our house. Tables, chairs, counterspace, floors, things on top of floors like coffee tables or just a box that had been left there for too long, became covered with whatever. And it wasn't so much an organic mess, but just paperwork and boxes and clothing and ... *things.*
 
 When she passed away, it took about a year and a half to fully clean out every space that she had occupied for any steady period of time. Her former home-office, for instance, which became kind of a catchall ground for, ""I don't know where this goes, let's put it in her old office,"" took the longest. It took about three people about a year and a half to finally get everything down to the carpeting in the walls, and it was repurposed into a new guestroom.
 
 When we got married I was 20 years old. When she passed away I was 45. That is a huge significant span of time and mental growth periods to cover. I didn't regret any of the 25 years that I was married to her, and I miss her very much. The only Pyrrhic victory I could claim over outlasting her, is that my dining room table has remained clutter free during the last three years."

 Not really a ""change"" I guess but you become much more aware of eachothers body stuff. How often they shower and brush their teeth. What they do with their hair every day.

After his contract lapsed in California, he moved out to Colorado and moved in with me. I will comment on my experience of having him move in with me.
 
 The main change that I did not expect was my life became far more structured when we moved in together. I used to frequently work well into the evening and then figure out my dinner plan on the way home. I used to whip up my meal and then eat it while standing at the counter or walking around doing things. Now we have a set dinner plan every night, and we actually take the time to sit down at the table with each other and have a conversation.
 
 Moving in together is over all a huge net positive. We cut our cost of living in half. We get to spend far more time together. We now have an awesome, adorable dog ([pupper tax](http://imgur.com/PMsnv99).) Life is good. My only complaint is that he is really good at making messes and then just walking away from them. I can leave for work and the kitchen will be spotless, and return home to find stacks of dishes in the sink and crumbs and other gunk covering the counter tops. We are working on the cleanliness issue though. 
 
 Edit: I've been reminding him pretty regularly for the past few months to put his dirty clothing in the hamper instead of throwing it on the ground next to the bed.

 But he immediately slipped back into the habit of expecting me to care for him like his mother did. So where I am of the idea that I will clean my messes, he will clean his messes, and we split the other chores evenly, he just expects me to take care of my messes and his messes and all of the chores. So I don't, and then he throws fits about the place being a mess and I ask, ""When did you last do the dishes? If you're so upset about the kitchen being a mess, why don't you take an hour to do your dishes?""
 
 But it just turns cyclical. He's say ""Well, one of those dishes is yours."" and I'll say, ""Yes, but I'm not complaining about the mess. And that doesn't change the fact that most of the dishes are yours.""
 
 But it always just falls on me. I don't mind living in clutter, so it turns into so many fights.
 
 It also destroyed our sex life. He has a low sex drive. Living separately meant that our alone time was a treat that took planning, living together just meant that sex was another of his chores. He's happy to spend the 5 minutes getting himself where he needs to be, but if I'm not done by them, sucks to suck, he's got to go play WoW."

 Then the ""honey moon phase"" drifted off, and our issues slowly started coming into play, we grew kind of distant and quiet with each other. As well as became annoyed with each other for every small thing. Fights grew bigger and bigger until one day, we both snapped and I moved out and decided I wasn't ready for this. We still loved each other deeply.
 
 I move back into my parents again, after a month of quietness, we talked again over a couple of days, apologized for our actions and understood where we both were coming from and her and I were not ready to move in because of our issues before we moved in.
 
 Fast forward 5 months later, we're increasingly getting better at understanding our needs. No where near perfect, but that's ok. I've bought a computer I've always wanted but couldn't afford, and she understood I've been wanting it for *years*. So now, I'm preparing to move in again, and she is too! Going on 5 years in June!

 But there are ways to compromise, and that's the good part about living together - if you recognize that each of you need to go with your strengths to support the other.
 
 For example, I love to cook. I do all the foods. I hate to clean. He does the majority of the cleaning. Laundry bothers me very little until I have to fold it and put it away. I wash and dry, he folds and puts up. I love gardening and outside work, he hates it. I handle the yard, he repairs stuff that breaks. 
 
 He's a TV watcher, I'm a reader. I read while he watches TV. I love to read Reddit, he Facebooks. We both find interesting crap and share it with each other. Many evenings are spent discussing completely useless esoterica we discover. i love metal, blues, techno, world and indie music. He's acoustic, classical and jazz . We alternate music every other night and have learned to appreciate each other's taste.

 I worked and she stayed home to care for our son, we really missed each other and when I would get home she would be exhausted and need a nap.

 The important thing is to make an effort. You don't always have to be the one making the effort but you can't expect them to either. Do the dishes some nights while they sit on the couch and relax, but expect them to do the same for you. If you are playing Skyrim for 9 hours and expect them to be ready to hang out as soon as you are done then you can't be mad when she does the same to you. And if you are ever having a disagreement about this, you need to talk about it. You are going to be around each other a hell of a lot more than you are going to be away from each other so don't let things bubble up. Lastly, having a good yelling match every now and then can be healthy, just make sure when you realize it's happening you try and wind it down. 
 
 Take it slow, give each other a lot of chances, and don't expect your relationship to be like anyone elses. It's your relationship and it's never going to be like anything else in the world.

 Our first weekend living together was Valentines Day 2015. A big snowstorm started that evening. He left and didn't come back until past midnight. As he was leaving to go out goodness-knows-where that evening, he told me to go to the gym. Because he knows the gym is my happy place. But I didn't have a car. He told me to ride my bike there. So I did. It was a horrible & cold experience. 
 
 But the gym being my happy place, I have a free lifetime worldwide membership to a certain chain of corporate gyms, so he suggested I try the one nearest his house, 3 miles away. I'd never been there before so after biking there in the snow that evening, the lady at the front desk told me my membership wasn't good there because it's a franchise, not corporate. 
 
 Cold & stranded on my bicycle, I made the best of things and went to get a pedicure in that shopping center. I needed uplifting. After an ironic hour of pampering bliss, the storm got worse, I biked 3 miles uphill to get back to the house but since it was my first time traveling that route, and especially in the snow, I had no point of reference knowing how long it would take, or if I'd even make it as the snow got deeper. I paused outside a hotel and considered getting a room for the night to escape the storm but when I realized I didn't have my phone charger I decided to continue uphill. 
 
 The wind was beating against me the whole way, and did I mention how sad & cold I was?? Too sad to even cry. Numb & in survival mode. 
 
 When I got back to the house 30 minutes later, I texted him a picture of me covered in snow. He flippantly responded, ""That's a lot of snow!"" He didn't respond to anything else from me that night. I felt like someone had vacuumed out my soul, numb from cold & dejection.
 
 After that I stayed in bed for several weeks, then at a doctor appt my doctor had reason to believe I was suicidal so she admitted me to the hospital in lockdown for 3 weeks 😒 SO visited me in the hospital once a week but never asked why I was there, or what he might be able to do to help me feel better. And I couldn't ask him for anything because he'd already saved me from homelessness. I was indebted to him so wouldn't dare ask anything more.
 
 That's how SO & I started living together."
111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reading these because I'm scared and about to move in with my SO. But this makes me so excited
112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He's insanely anal about knowing where everything is, yet he has no designated place for anything. I collect his everyday items and put them on the hall table each night to try to help him out. He's an all around wonderful person, so it is the least that I can do to make his mornings go more smoothly."
113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I stopped eating take-out and fast food... as much.
 
 Oh, and apparently became more social. For some reason, when you have a female in the house, people WANT to hang out with you."
114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,her farting
115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Farts. So many farts.
116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I got away from my mother. (We moved in young.) 
 
 Which in turn eased a lot of my stress. So i was actually happy again. 
 
 Also the bed shrank. We had a twin for a while, which... Wasn't too comfortable, but we managed."
117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not my current boyfriend, but my ex. He was a bodybuilder, when we moved in together, I realized what a fucking nightmare it was. You know what a small apartment smells like after six months of cooking fish for dinner every night? I do!
 
 Also, he had a taste for the finer things. That would have been okay if we hadn't been dirt poor. For example, we really didn't need to find the best five-star restaurant in Orlando.
 
 We had a good relationship, but nothing in common. There's honestly so many stories about that relationship."
118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Farts. Everybody farts, but i learned that it's almost guaranteed she'd win any sort of fart contest"
119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My partner and I moved in together a few weeks ago. So far, I've already noticed that we are fighting way way way less. I think being able to see more of each other's daily experiences and little moments has made us more sympathetic and willing to compromise and be extra good to each other."
120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I realized a lot of the shit I used to do when I was living alone I only did to deal with the loneliness. My desire to play online games, read quietly for hours, and jerk off six times a day tapered off then a couple years in it totally collapsed. I still like books and video games and masturbation but I don't need them to function anymore."
121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"honestly, not having to drive as much. we had been dating for about 6 months, and her housing situation was about to go downhill, and i had extra room, so we decided to have her move in for a week, see how it goes, then make a decision. that's when we realized she only really went home to sleep or get ready for class. saved us both a lot of driving. we decided to make it permanent. honesty, we're both kindof slobs, but our place looks much better than our individual apartments ever did."
122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Getting used to living with someone who squeezes the toothpaste tube from the middle. 
 
 Edit: It's worth it though."
123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My weight and blood pressure.
124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pooping with the door open
125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm a guy who likes to cry, I'd cry myself to sleep often or just come home from a rough day and cry. Can't do that anymore now that I live with my SO. I love her but I miss being able to sit on the balcony while listening to sad music, crying, and smoking a cigarette."
126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Quality of sleep. There's nothing better than when you're really tired, the room is kinda cold, they're already asleep and you curl up next to them under the covers & their body heat & presence alone drift you into a heavenly sleep."
127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It's weird falling asleep when they aren't in bed beside me
128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"All of a sudden, she farts so much. The eye contact fart, the slowly tuck the covers under her fart, and the standing strained face fart. She doesn't burp....ever. Just the farts."
129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Every light is now on all the time. Also, every surface is now covered in cats, especially the keyboarhtrssc B FG mcdsjk KB b"
130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I stopped having to do laundry. Funny story about that. The other day I was trying to refold a t-shirt and put it away and was having trouble with it. I asked her how in the hell did you fold this like that? She called me an idiot and said I was the one her taught her how to do it. 8 years ago. I guess this is a perfect example of ""if you don't use it, you lose it""."
131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We fart in front of each other a lot more now and laugh about it. We're both feminine women.
132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The blowjob's stopped happening.
133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is going back about 10 years ago. I was 21, my ex was 19. He had dropped out of high school at 15 to get his GED and stay home with his toddler brother, then started college courses at 16. His mother worked long crazy hours, so he'd had a lot of the household responsibilities - bringing his brother to/from school, grocery shopping, cooking, household chores, etc.
 
 A few months after we got our apartment together he celebrated his 20th birthday by hanging out with a lot of 13 and 14 year old kids he met at the skate park. Suddenly he was getting together with them every weekend that I worked. It was like he decided that now he was going to re-live his lost teenaged years. Very frustrating to me, and was one of the contributing factors to the downfall of our relationship."
134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33 years. My life got a whole lot better.
135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I get MUCH less sleep. If I get woke up in the middle of the night I tend to stay awake for hours. My wife is prone to moving around a lot in her sleep, snoring, all sorts of various things. I've tried keeping to the edge of the bed, wearing a blindfold and earplugs, white noise, wrapping myself in my own seperate blanket, etc. I love her to death but I'm seriously considering getting another bed and turning a very large, unused closet we have into a tiny bedroom I can sleep in on work nights."
136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Life got better :)
137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Its alot harder to well give each other space, I love my ex (I still do) but things went wrong when we lived together, I have mental health issues which combined with just general stress from work lead me to having psyche hospitalisations and stuff. Also coming out as transgender probably made things harder (I guess not having my own space made it more obvious to him) 
 
 So yeah I can be a jerk"
138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I changed country and continent. No regrets
139,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Well. We got a really cute rottie/shepherd mix. He is the love of our life and we cuddle with him all the time. So he gets in bed a lot. He also lays all over our clothes if we don't fold them immediately. He sheds. A lot. I sleep naked. Often. I'm not circumcised. I get dog hair in my dick.
140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Guilt about not cleaning constantly. I mean, I still don't. I just feel guilty about it now"
141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Toilet seat wars. Wardrobe invasion. The quality of food has gone up though definitely.
142,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"First night we stayed together, we where watching a movie in bed. She decides she's hungry and goes get cookies. Already I'm thinking : ""crumbs in the bed"". But then she tells me a random story and I shit you not, she put here cookies in the Fucking bed! Not on a plate, not on a napkin but directly in the sheets! Utterly barbaric..."
143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,She learned to fart.....
144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My husband says that the biggest change when I moved in with him was the appearance of blankets and pillows. Before me he slept with one pillow, a sheet, and turned the heat up. Now he has six pillows, clean sheets every week (the heathen only did them every couple of months!), and a nice fluffy blanket.
 
 For me, it would be that I ended up having to relax my cleanliness. He's a bit of a slob!"
145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Somebody else gets to do all the dumb chores I don't like! (At least some of the time, anyway.)"
146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The amount of laundry and sex increased exponentially.
147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A stark realization that we have very different standards of living.
148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I took over managing his bills and our communal bills. He was paying monthly late fees on credit card bills he had the cash to pay off in full. WTH.
149,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The fact that I realized I never wanted to be around that person again, then I moved back to my home state"
150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Getting laid on weekdays and not just on the weekends! 😉
151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,An uncontrollable need to constantly monitor the thermostat.
152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Morning breath. We all have it, ugly people fat people gorgeous people and any other combo. The problem is when you live alone or at least sleep alone waking up with your own morning breath is fine. Waking up with your significant other is wonderful but Jesus her breath is like old socks and moldy cheese together. That was the biggest thing I noticed, little stuff like that and then a ton a fun stuff if you and your partner are happy together. Like her making cupcakes all the time! And sex a lot more frequently."
153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I get incredibly attached and now whenever he has to stay away for even a night due to work im basically completely lost. :(
154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,She stopped hiding the mess
155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Well, there's another person and another cat in bed at night."
156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I GOT A DOGGO
157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Positive: Always someone there when you need to talk or just crave human interaction. Don't have to cook every night and someone to help out with normal shit that needs done around the house. 
 
 Negative: You learn to live without **real** alone time, but sometimes you just need it. Guilty feelings if you want to go out with a friend to just have ""guy time."" (not talking about guilt-tripping or anything, just the normal guilt from going out to have fun while leaving SO alone at home, which usually results in me not going either.) 
 
 Also, sharing hot water."
158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Walking into the bathroom and seeing my wife's first skid marks
159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Your life becomes no longer about yourself individually. You say ""we"" instead of ""I"" almost exclusively. You realize you go weeks without having any truly alone time. And even if younger you would have thought you'd hate all of this, it works, and you're happy."
160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When I was 16, my boyfriends house was on fire and he lost his home, and the only place for him was my house.
 
 What changed: my attendance and grades went down, and I started getting a lot of anxiety and depression around that time of my life. 
 
 My boyfriend isnt a bad person or anything, but having him move in at such a young age affected my self image and distracted me from school."
161,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have someone to come home to. I know that's the obvious byproduct of living with someone, but hear me out. I used to go out and do things after work without telling anyone where I was going. No one was affected. Now I have someone who expects me to be home around a certain time so that we can share a meal together.
 
 Ultimately, I have to be more considerate of others."
162,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The joy of having a 4 year old banging on the door at 10 pm wanting a glass of water during our sexy time.
163,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Way more talks while pooping
164,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Both of our relationships to my kid have changed since we moved in together. It made him realize that he needed to put in effort to grow that relationship since being a stepparent doesn't come naturally to him (or anyone). And he also takes me seriously when I make suggestions about when and how he can correct my child behaviorally.
 
 And it also changed my relationship with my son. My fiancee has stood by me in earning more custody and strengthening my relationship to my son. I feel more confident as a parent. And it helps my sanity to have this person who I trust with absolutely everything there when I need to cry or complain about parenting."
165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We got happier.
 
 My SO travels a lot for work and his schedule was opposite of mine. Often it made more sense for him to stay home because he got off work so late , and our schedules were hard enough to merge let alone with the added need to stop home and get over night things packed. So living together allows us to have dinner every night, say good night each evening before bed in person and say good bye in the morning. The extra time together has made us so much stronger, we rely on one another more, we created a perfect system for us. It's like there's no distance between us at all now.
 
 My family was upset we moved in together while dating but it was honestly the best decision for our relationship. I know without a doubt now that we can have a happy fulfilling life in spite of our crazy schedules."
166,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We talk less. Since we see each other every night we really don't have anything to catch up on. I mean we still talk but we don't do the whole talk for hours anymore. It makes me a little sad sometimes.
167,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My girlfriend and I have an ongoing game where we try to jump scare each other and have a score board on the fridge. Our house is one story and has a bedroom with two doors making the house operate as a circle or circuit as we call it. Its very good for sneaking up on someone. I am currently down by 5 scares. She's like a cat.
168,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A LOT less fucking and a LOT more drama.
169,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sleep schedule. She works during the day, while I'm at home because of my disability so I end up sleeping all day because her snoring is much like a tractor trailer full of clowns juggling chainsaws on a cobblestone road so I tend not to sleep much when she's sleeping."
170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The power bill increased 4x... To this day i'm still not sure where all that electricity is actually going.
171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I am always the big spoon. I'm a full foot shorter and about 100lbs lighter than him, but that's how we fall asleep. At night, I turn into his jetpack."
172,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pillows I had two pillows but we have nine and she still steals mine.
173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'm an elementary music teacher. I really prioritized getting school work done at school. Being around him all the time made me hate having to do lesson plans at home. I've never enjoyed my weeknights and weekends more!
174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can't sleep by myself anymore :( he's warm
 and comfy"
175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Being able to quickly fall asleep, when I was alone I could never fall asleep. I just laid in bed for hours with my thoughts, typically worrying about things that didn't matter. Being next to my wife I fall asleep instantly. Also, she wakes up before me and builds the fire and makes coffee. I love stumbling half awake to the fireplace and being handed a cup of hot coffee in the morning."
176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I met my SO 7.5 years ago while visiting her roommate (my childhood friend) at the college she went to. That night we bickered like an old married couple. She wanted a night to have fun with friends and I was an intrusion, and I thought she was fairly stuck up. After that we soon added each other on FB and talked every day and starting that year we always attended family holidays together (even if either of us were dating someone else). I fell in love with her and I told her as much and we started talking more and more sporadically. We were still best friends though and we still told each other everything (even the stuff that would hurt to hear). 
 
 About a year ago we started talking again while I was in a relationship with someone else. I wasn't happy and I told her as much, and she asked all the questions a best friend would ask. That relationship ended in May and she made plans with me for June (we both worked a lot so it was hard to get together). She told me she realized she loved me too about two years earlier, but didn't want to disrupt my relationship. I, still being in love with her, asked her to be my girlfriend on the spot. 
 
 Since then I switched jobs to live closer to her and then we moved in together. After being best friends for so long and having no barriers or boundaries the thing that changed most for me was how much I still didn't know. We had taken trips together and had extended stays in each other's company multiple times before, but I feel like I still pick up new little things daily and as I get to know her better I feel like I love her more completely as a person. I understand her better. 
 
 I now work nights at a hospital while she works days so we don't see each other as much as when we first moved in. I think that has helped us. Things that we did when I would travel a few hours to see her once or twice a month now happen daily and those things always get me through my day and my commute home each morning. Just little things like notes or she made me breakfast for when I got home because she would be gone for most of the day. I can feel that she loves me too more by those little things than just her words could express. 
 
 I know it's all a little sappy and sounds too good to be true. I'm still shell shocked by it all. I raged against the confines of my ""friendzone"" prison for years while always taking on the role of best friend. It paid off though, an,d as of Christmas Eve of 2016, that best friend is now my fiancé."
177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Got to touch her butt all the time instead of just at weekends
178,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I used to HATE snoring, my ex's snored and i just wanted to suffocate them in their sleep. Moved in with my girlfriend, and she has the cutest snore, and it means she's getting good sleep and everytime i hear it, it makes me smile. Each day spending with her is more amazing than the last, and it feels right.
 
 TLDR: turned into a soppy dickhead!"
179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"She used to come over to my place, take my shirt off and throw me on a bed, that's all gone now. She's throws me on a bed and then falls asleep on top of me."
180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I started indulging in illicit narcotics. And when I say illicit narcotics, I mean weed."
181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Get to honk booty every night and apparently cousin IT moved in with her as well.....
182,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Everything. Before Minerva & I were married, years ago, we moved in with each other. It was hard, she is in a wheelchair and she had 6 dogs, and we were all in one tiny bedsit. She never really does annoying things but sometimes you will just be in a bad mood and anything will annoy you, so I guess it was our attitudes that changed the most and we learned to recognise that and not let each other take things out on each other. So much good things happen to you when you find love and get to share your life experiences together!"
183,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,her butt got bigger
184,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The already scarce and mediocre sex became worse and less often.
185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Everything changes. I stay up late after she sleeps to get some me time. Shoes everywhere. More arguing. What sucks the most is when we are bored. When you get bored by yourself you have an excuse. Bored with the SO and you start questioning if it is you, her or just supposed to be boring. And then some more arguing abd resentment."
186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No room left on the bed, no room left in the bedroom."
187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bags. Bags everywhere.
188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You will never be able to enjoy doing anything alone. Ever.
189,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Her.
190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Always find u have less sex after u move in together.
191,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The amount of sex went down dramatically and the amount of hair the bathroom sink went way up. How is she not bald!?
192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wires. Wires everywhere.
193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It was our first house together, couldn't wait for the unlimited sex on tap. Ended up barely seeing each other due to work & lifestyle commitments. Realised a year in it wasn't working"
194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No matter how much I buy, there never seems to be any toilet paper. I've fallen to such extents that I now hide an emergency stash under the sink (think, stuffed into a sandwich bag and taped to the back/bottom of the sink)."
195,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Familiarity breeds contempt.
196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't get sex every night like I used to when she would come over. Hell its few and far between now, like once in the past 3 months."
197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Moving in together strengthened our relationship. We are more affectionate with each other, communicate better, and argue less often. It's been almost 3 years and it was the best decision we've made! Although, his hair and my hair combined have broken the most heavy duty vacuum."
198,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I no longer take being alone for granted
199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A bunch of useless pillows were purchased for the bed and my knick knacks went into the spare bedroom or into boxes.
200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The ability to watch and do what I want without complaint or criticism. The ability to make myself something to eat without being made to feel like I'm an inconsiderate bitch for not offering to make him anything.
201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I haven't noticed any changes. 
 
 He might tell you other wise- bobby pins and hair everywhere."
202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He slept better, I ate more regularly and healthier. His bathroom got cleaned more often. My kitchen got less messy, as before I lived in a shared apartment."
203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I no longer make lunch, dinner or do laundry. It's great. Plus sex every night and almost every morning. It's great. I highly recommend my girlfriend, just get your own."
204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not much, i moved her in the first month. Its been 4 years now."
205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I haven't done the dishes in a year and a half. Biggest win ever! I hate doing dishes but don't terribly mind laundry. He always has clean clothes and I always have clean dishes. Win win.
206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,THERE IS HAIR EVERYWHERE!!!!!
207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coffee cups EVERYWHERE!!!
208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nothing. My wife was my roommate in college for years before we started dating. We moved into the house at the same time, so everything has always been the same as it was then, more or less."
209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The surprising amount of pee splash-back around the toilet area, the amount of hair on my unshaven legs and the constant mess everywhere, even 5 mins after cleaning and tidying. But there's no way I'd ever go back to living separately. As my SO says ""It's like a sleepover every night."""
210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It was tough because she wasn't an affectionate person at all. Like hugs and cuddles would make her feel like I was strangling her and she would push me away angrily, kisses were an issue with her because no matter what, it would cause some sort of irritation. Physical affection is something that I really need and never got from her. After some years we tried to compromise on needs for each other but my needs would never be addressed or fixed. We finally decided we weren't right for each other. When we decided together it was the most painfully indifferent feeling I have ever felt, no heartbreak, no tears, just an ""Ok."""
211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I actually eat dinner every night. And it's almost always a home cooked meal. Don't get me wrong, I actually like cooking, but I despise grocery shopping."
212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I realized he chews with HIS GODDAMNED MOUTH OPEN! 
 
 Otherwise things are amazing still."
213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not much has changed she is a little more messy. It's actually kinda scary she hasn't even farted infront of me and we've been married for 10 years.
214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My hairline
215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The sheer amount of food that this man can put away😳😳😳
216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Movie attendance. I used to go 2-3 times/week. She's not a real fan and I don't want to do that sort of thing without her. So now, it's 1x/fortnight. Maybe"
217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My relationship status.
 From ""taken"" to ""single"". 
 Well, can't work out for everyone I guess."
218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I moved straight out of living at home with my parents and siblings into living with my girlfriend, and the biggest (and probably my favourite) change is being able to just go around the house completely naked most of the time."
219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My sleeping pattern. Every night we fall asleep on the couch together, wake up between 2am and 3am then go to bed until our alarms go off."
220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The sex and the fact that we could have it finally lol
221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,She started eating vegetables and other healthier food. And experimenting with cooking things other than meat with cheese and possibly noodles. I am still the main cook of the home and she is just fine with that.
222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I got lazy and stopping going to the gym. We are literally fat and happy. But I have started going back to the gym.
223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"talking about money. the conversation changes once you both have to share the bills. however, i'm mostly the problem. i'm stubborn and i don't like admitting when i can't pull my weight. i'm working on it!"
224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Downtime.
 
 Previously we had always been doing something fun, exciting, or interesting while together. Now that we had our own place, he'd be watching the news, and I'd be sewing."
225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'm moving in with my SO in a few days. Reading the replies here isn't filling me with confidence xD
226,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We had less stress
227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,That you can't just get up and go someplace without a brief explanation of where you are going.
228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,How much we text each other. We used to text each other all the time when we weren't together. Now we're either busy (work/class) or together so we barely text!
229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Everything. For the love of God never cohabitants. Date them. Marry them if you want to. Buy the fucking house next door. You will never be the same.
230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cooking actual meals instead of boxed ones. Every drain being plugged with hair. And lastly all the animals
231,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I used to just eat random probably-not-healthy-for-me junk food. Whatever was easiest/quickest. Now I get breakfast in bed. I'm talking homemade biscuits (still working on that tho) in homemade sausage gravy with French toast, scrambled eggs, and fried potatoes. Oh my Lord."
232,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He was suddenly allergic to my cat and wanted me to get rid of her. Ya no.
233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Everything got easy. We didn't have to worry about where we'd meet up, who was getting off work when, how much we'd see each other that week, etc etc. Whatever else was going on, we'd spend the night together and we'd see each other at home eventually. 
 
 Also for a while he kept my place real neat. Turns out his cleanliness was stress-related, and now he's a happy enough person to be a slob like me."
234,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alone time becomes a thing of the past. 10 minutes in the bathroom is my new ""personal time""."
235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We started to hate each other.
236,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Looking forward to seeing each other to have sex. 
 
 Edit. Let me clarify, I still look forward to seeing her to have sex, but for her it's more about spending time together."
237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Her hair..... everywhere, we even have a corner of our bedroom where it collects."
238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I've become a far tidier person
239,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"*in whispered, dying Col. Kurtz voice *The farting, the farting."
240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hair everywhere. It's like tumbleweed.... Or tribbles. It's just everywhere
241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Just a giant mess between both of us.
242,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I find it difficult to fall asleep without my girlfriend.
243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I finally felt like I had a home. Oh and there's a fuck ton more laundry. It's still mostly mine though. :P
244,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The amount of time I listened to her coughing/cleaning her throat. It went from several seconds per week, to about an hour a day."
245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I didn't spend days living out of a bag or driving home at ridiculous hours of the night/morning. I always have my dog with me now and get to sleep in my own bed.
246,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"i've taught myself how to cook, and actually enjoy it quite a bit. and it's nice never going to bed alone."
247,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It was his place first, so now I'm having to adjust to using a new brand of butter. His brand is far nicer, but I've used the same one for 20+ years so I'm not willing to admit that to him."
248,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ours changed by living together and with our newborn pretty quickly. Realized just how different we are. 
 
 He wakes up with just enough time to shower and leave. I wake up and make food and do laundry, and clean up and spend time with people. He wants to stay up all night, I want to go to bed before 3am. He does what he wants, I do what I want, we have our own rooms now and it works for the most part."
249,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We watched a lot more movies and had more sex... a lot more.
250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He complains. So. Much.
 
 Well, not really. He just notes things that are somehow an issue in a way that makes it sound like a complaint to my ears. Most of them are perfectly reasonable observations, yet somehow, some combination of his tone and my ears makes 'The next time you go to the store could you get more Sriracha?' sound like 'Why did you let our Sriracha reserves fall to such low levels?'
 
 TBH this problem is more about my self-esteem than his tone. Objectively I know that. Emotionally I get defensive."
251,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Me.
252,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I started spending way more time at my side pieces place.
253,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot less sex.
 
 
 
 ...like 80-85% fewer engagements."
254,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Farting.
255,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Farts
256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My ability to control how I act around him. It all comes out now, all the good and the bad. I can't be super sweet all the time, he sees me at my worst. The same goes for him, too. We know each other way better now, and (I like to think) we love each other even more now."
257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don't have a clean laundry basket and a dirty laundry basket anymore. Now I have to use the dresser and closet properly.
258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"She reads my comment history sometimes now, sup M"
259,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Surprisingly there's less sex.
260,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I only play video games when she's sleeping or taking a bath lol I used to be that guy that played for 18 hours straight when I had the chance to do so. Not so much these days. I've tried to get her into playing video games but she got bored
261,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Me and my SO live together at the age of 18 and 19. I live at home with my parents and she lives here with me. Her family situation is complicated but improving so she may spend a couple nights with her mom or her brother here and there but for the most part she's here with me. We've been together for 4 years now (starting on the 21st) and things haven't changed much. Before this we spent many weekends together. Sleeping in the same bed isn't anything new to us, so there hasn't been as much change. And keep in mind she works about 5 days out of the week from 1-9 pm. I am a highschool student so my schedule is like 6am-3pm. So we still get time apart but we are together much more often. This has brought about some change, and the most obvious one I've found is we text less and fight less. I feel like we're both happier as people even with her depression. All in all I love living with her and plan on spending the rest of my life doing so. 
 
 Edit: also now sleeping alone is near impossible. If she is not by my side I can not do it. I'll toss and turn all night till 4 am."
262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's so hard to be apart from them, even if you're pissed at them , at the end of the day you still want to be around them."
263,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The laundry chores exploded. He has so much clothes! And he didn't even take all of it with him. He could wear a different outfit for 50-60 days straight without washing once. But he needs it all and keeps buying. It's insane.
264,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You aren't alone by default anymore. It's a pro and a con.
265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Peeing while the other person is in the bathroom is a thing now. 
 
 Maybe by next year we'll get to pooping near each other, too. These are the real milestones that matter."
266,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He steals my moisturizer and conditioner. His sweatshirt collection became our sweatshirt collection. My bacon, butter, and bread intake has increased tenfold. Apparently leaving cabinet doors open is annoying? I didn't realize there are people who don't empty their plates/bowls of leftover food in the trash before putting said containers in the sink...barbaric... We both annoy the piss out of each other sometimes but idk i hope it gets better! I miss him when hes not here"
267,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You tend to specialize in stuff around the house. There are things I haven't done for over 10 years because it fell into my husband's wheelhouse and vice versa.
268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We moved in together probably only after like a month or less of dating, and everyone thought we were crazy. But we found out we are literally the exact same person, just male and female versions of each other. We've been together for over 5 years now. So I guess nothing really changed at all, except I live with my male doppelganger."

270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We moved into a bigger, nicer apartment in a more desirable location for the same combined rent. Grocery shopping became easier. Cooking was more efficient because everything is portioned for two. 
 
 Use the app ""Splitwise"" and have a good financial plan for how you split bills."
271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He stopped eating mac n cheese for every damned meal, and I stopped playing aggrotech at 4am :P"
272,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What time I went to sleep and how much room on the bed I get. My whole bathroom and closet were taken over also. Still love her.
273,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No more blowjobs.
 
 I'm like one of those starving people who stays alive off of the thought of food alone."
274,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think my situation is a bit unique as mine moved in 4 days after we met. (No, I'm not kidding).
 
 In general, I'd say it seems to recreate a different kind of intimacy, especially in a smaller home - You can't just ""wander to the bedroom"" as a euphemism for going to the bathroom - so we made it a personal joke. 
 
 I found that I became very home-bound - before I'd go out with my friends a lot and go out to things after work. After he arrived, I wanted to be home with him all the time. I think I went out with friends after work twice in 3 months (as opposed to 2-3 times a month) and had them over a few times, too. I would think that this would even out eventually when it's not so wrapped up in the ""honeymoon"" period. 
 
 When he was away for a week, home didn't feel like home. Too quiet, empty and cold. I don't sleep as well, either. Especially the days when I get home from night shift and he'd been sleeping on my side of the bed deliberately to warm it for me. 
 
 He's away again at the moment. We talk every day through the day and at bedtime, but it's not the same."
275,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I lost my fortress of solitude.
276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My refrigerator finally had food in it.
277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The stupid fights got dumber. My wife is currently still pissed off bc I had a headache from hell and didn't want to make her a snack.
278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A few things;
 -I get in trouble for how many shoes I have. I have three pairs. She has nearly 30 outside of her closet.
 -Sex pretty much stops
 -Never being truly alone.
 -Alone time is interrupted.
 -I can't take a damned nap without being made to feel guilty for it. 
 -Sleeping in on Saturday is a bad thing too; I leave the house first and get home late. And she is always already napping when I get home.
 -I need to stop before I get really annoyed thinking about this crap..."
279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He went from not liking cats and tea to having his own personal cat (now I get 2!!) and his own personal teas. 
 
 I now read Reddit and follow some sports teams."
280,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nothing at all? I didn't exactly know, to be honest. We met on WoW, and we talked for a little over a year. Had met several times (families included). Then he decided he wanted to move to Texas to be with me. It felt right, we meshed really well. Looking back, it was a horribly big risk.
 
 I was living with my grandparents at the time, so I decided that was the time to leave. I was 19. When he moved down, we found an apartment and moved in together. Everything clicked into place, and I haven't known anything different. Maybe it's because I've never lived alone in my entire life, and I'm used to having people around. He's a few years older than me as well (3.5).
 
 I'm 28 now, will be 29 in June. We've been together ever since. Got married 5 years ago... we stayed that way just in case things went south. But we weren't having issues at all :P Still don't. I think I just lucked out."
281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My husband has always slept on the right, closest to our door. Two kids later and guess who gets woken up first each morning by our little alarm clocks...choose wisely!"
282,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Realizing he can hear everything I do. We have a pretty tiny apartment and thin walls. 
 
 
 Oh and the farting. Much much more farting."
283,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Too scared to watch hentai
284,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cleaning became a weekly ritual rather than ""Oh, I'll get to it once a month, if I'm lucky"" type of thing. Also, we eat a lot better as a result (I do breakfast salads, we scavenge for lunch, and dinner menu is drawn up at the end of each weekend.)"
285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I lost my saying in everything.
286,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"That I finally have a human being sleeps beside me and she cleans my house! =D 
 
 I am a slob."
287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He stopped being a functioning human being without my help. I assume he could function fine before we moved in together, his house was never dirty and I assume he remembered to feed his cat on a regular basis. We've been living together for the past 3 years, and he only feeds the cat if I ask him 5 times (even if I'm out of town). He also today asked me if I could make him his fiber smoothie because he couldn't figure out how to get the blender to work. Unfortunately he appears to also be completely blind when it comes to finding the hamper for his socks. 
 I still love him, but damn it's like having a toddler sometimes"
288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sex 2-3 times a week to once a fiscal quarter.
 
 Don't get married, kids."
289,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"How to share 1 bathroom and 1 toilet. I didn't realize females did pooping until I moved in with her. 
 Man..... ignorance was bliss"
290,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Everything I do is now wrong.
291,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We're having a LOT more sex.
292,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Found out he's just as messy as I am. Not dirty, just has the same affliction to putting clothes away after they're clean, or putting them in the basket when dirty."
293,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think the biggest change was that we stopped loving each other for a bit there. Of course we were sharing just a bedroom, not a house."
294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Small stuff for me. I was thinking the other day about how much I used to love wearing perfume in high school and college, but perfume sets off the boyfriend's allergies so I stopped. Worth it."
295,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My bride doesn't like noise. I used to have music playing on my computer basically 24/7. I use headphones a hell of a lot more now - used to be they were just for voice chat. 
 
 TBH, though, it could be worse. She used to keep a clean kitchen before we moved in together."
296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Having to let go of being so uptight regarding neatness in the house. I'm working on it and so is he.
297,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's just the same as before moving in together, except a lot more amplified. Those same annoyances when not living together can turn into major deal-breakers once you take that next step."
298,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Less ""Me"" time than before. 
 
 Part of it is that if I'm off screwing around in the garage, I feel guilty that I'm blowing her off in favor of a car, other part is sometimes when I want to do something on my own, she has different plans."
299,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We're insanely happily married now, but lived together for a few years prior to getting married. When we moved in together it was some culture shock- I'm not a tidy person when it comes to my personal space, but common areas like the kitchen and living room I discovered I preferred to be at least not filthy. There was definitely some culture shock: I was gradually getting better at keeping things tidy, while he was getting worse at it. We worked it out (are still working at it), but communication was critical. Bottom line- open your mouth and talk about it if you have a problem. When you live together, it's not like you only have to put up with it for a few hours and then you can go home."
300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My masturbation schedule.
301,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The direct that the number in my checking account was going.
302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We were able to nooky each other with startling frequency rather than having to wait for weekends. It saved us money, too, as I lived nine hours away from him and traveling is pricey."
303,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our communication skills not just with each other, but in general. I used to only be able to have a dialogue with my SO and only when we spent the weekend at each others places. Until I met him I was horrible at communication. I really opened up when we started living together last year."
304,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We don't live together anymore but-
 
 I learned to do laundry. Learned that he procrastinated on doing it himself on a much larger level than I previously thought. It wasn't really much of an issue though. I usually got him in there to help me put it away.
 
 I started eating a lot more homecooked meals, too- his doing. 
 
 I also had to basically hunt for socks every time I did laundry because they were everywhere (small apartment)."
305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He broke my oven the first week he moved in. 4 years later and we still have to put a chair against the oven when we cook. My house is definitely messier (me included) the hard bit is if you fall out. It took my boyfriend a while to realise I need to be left to calm down. It's the adjusting to someone else being there. I love it but if I ever get home and he isn't home before me and I don't know why it's a horrible panicky feeling that something bad happened. I also get that feeling if my dog doesnt jump at me as I enter the house.
306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The cleanliness of my home. When I made a mess living on my own, I cleaned it up. I left the house, came back, and it looked the same. Nice. 
 Now, I clean. I leave. I come back. It's trashed. I may be a little OCD with cleanliness (not like disinfecting everything everywhere all the time, just ya know, you get something out you put it away). He's not like that, although he has gotten better... some days. I love him though, the messy bastard. 
 And the laundry. God the laundry. Dirty clothes go on the floor, not the hamper. I wash them, fold them, stack them for him to put away and he picks from the neatly stacked clothing and that's what he wears. And then it goes on the floor hahahahahaha. Typical male I guess???? 
 Maybe I'll get him trained someday. We've only lived together for like 2ish years so there's......hope????"
307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lots of sex!!!
308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I realized how messy she was.
309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,How annoyed I felt w him breathing down my back. 😐
310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sleeping... I wake up from her snoring all the time now.
 
 I snore sometimes too though."
311,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mostly the happiness.
312,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The realization set in that this probably won't go far. Some people are masters of disguise.
313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My gaming time. :(
314,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The kitchen cabinets are never shut.
315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hm..
 
 When we first started dating, I'd end up cleaning his apartment whenever I went over. Dishes, dusting, sweeping, putting shit away, etc. I kind of moved in because of an emergency and had no where else to go, and now I barely clean because the apartment is a disaster within an hour again. I wouldn't say we have less sex, because we didn't really have a lot of sex to begin with. The problem there is he has a very low sex drive and I have a very high one, so I take a lot of showers or baths now to.. release the tension.
 
 We're in a very small studio so I don't have any time to myself. But we honestly don't spend a lot of time together or do a whole lot together. He games a lot (at least five hours a day, usually more) while I sit around the apartment pretty much doing nothing so I feel much more neglected now than I did before. 
 
 We don't argue as much anymore though. We'll point out when one of us is being really stupid, apologize, and get over it. 
 
 It's definitely not perfect. It was a lot more rushed than I wanted it to be (we've been dating since June of 2016 and I moved in in November) but I appreciate that we don't judge each other, we care about each other, and we'll pretty much do anything for each other. He knows me better than I know myself sometimes and it's nice to have someone that loves you and thinks you're perfect, flaws and all."
316,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I actually eat dinner because he likes to cook and is really good at it. Left to my own devices, I'll have grilled cheese or dry cereal or cheese and fruit."
317,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We broke up.
318,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I started doing all his laundry instead of his mom, and we sleep in the same bed. Nothing else changed, we've been totally happy for 9 years (8 years living together)."
319,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amount of stress-free gaming time went down.
320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sex life
321,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Privacy and free time gone
322,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My bed gets made every day now.
323,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hair mostly.Money becomes a bit different but that varys from couple to couple in our relationship its not an issue. One thing is Bedtime. Im a solid 7 hours of sleep before work whilst my SO is a "" let's stay up and only get 4 hrs of sleep""( I'm a light sleeper so if I hear or feel activity around me I cant sleep and get annoyed."
324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You are expected back home pretty much everyday.
325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sex
326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"How he doesn't pick up his clothes from the floor, EVER."
327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not having to deal with my parents all the time.
328,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My Masturbation schedule
329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I felt more relaxed. Before I lived with my parents, I didn't get along with my step mom. She made me very uncomfortable and she was difficult to live with. I hid in my room all the time and was made to feel bad.
 
 Once I moved in with my SO it felt so nice to roam around the house and just relax anywhere while feeling comfortable. :)"
330,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Me being shy about anything
331,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Having to be quiet cuz he sleeps way earlier than me. And not getting to watch the shows I like, cuz we try to find things we both like."
332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He stunk out the whole house (which was empty because we had just moved in and didn't get our furniture yet) with his socks and feet. 
 
 But we are very happy that we live together."
333,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cleaning. My *thing* when living alone was to just make a mess as I go and then once a week, spend a couple of hours cleaning up everything. I'd get food or anything that smelled or had the potential to smell into the trash, but I'd leave clothes and books lying around and empty bottles of beer/soda on my desk, dishes stacked up next to my desk, whatever. I kinda liked it as during the hour or two I'd clean the place top to bottom, I'd crank some music or listen to an audiobook or something and have a little ""me time"". 
 
 He's much more of a neat freak than I am and so I can't really let stuff build up like that. I'm still a bit of a slob, but I haven't had my ""clean days"" in a few years. It makes him happier when I clean up after myself and so I do it."
334,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My husband and I moved in together after about a month of dating (yes, we're insane). The biggest change was learning to compromise on things. He was used to living alone, so leaving a plate in the bedroom wasn't a big deal to him, but it was to me so he learned to stop doing it. I had to get used to not leaving my shoes wherever I took them off. But we figured it out and our now on our third apartment together.
 
 He's been deployed for almost half a year, so it'll be interesting to see how things will be when he comes home (especially because I've arranged this apartment just so). But we'll get through it."
335,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sex went from everyday to like, once every few weeks. Kind of felt like a 'Gotcha!'."
336,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I find myself going, ""where the fuck is it? I HAD IT FIVE SECONDS AGO"""
337,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I eat healthier than I want to and drink less than I'd like.
338,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We broke up!
 
 Thank fuck for that."
339,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The sex, lack of it"
340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The ability to just leave
341,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"After living alone for several years, had to re-train myself to close the door while pooping. That was a big one. 
 
 So to speak."
342,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My electricity bill like doubled when he moved in. 
 
 But other than that just the general, there is always someone when I want to be around somebody. Like, I don't have to be lonely...he's just there."
343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The happy went away on her part. She became salty and comes home every day in a terrible mood. I don't know what to do. As much as I try, nothing helps. I love this woman more than life itself but if I can't help, what can I do? It's ripping me apart inside."
344,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cleaning habits are the hardest part for me and my boyfriend!
345,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EVERYTHING
346,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Every single cupboard was mysteriously left open
347,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Having to deal with the nagging. Oh my gosh the nagging. Her biggest pet peeve is my dishes from my lunchbox at work - if I don't rinse them out enough she claims they smell. If I don't I will hear about it and read about it and it gets old.
348,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,His snoring WAS the cutest thing ever..
349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I do 6x laundry. :(
350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We're pretty much nudists now.
351,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The country I live in.
352,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I get laid whenever i want.
353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,She has developed napoleon syndrome
354,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Funny answer: She broke up with me. 
 
 Serious answer: We slowly resented each other and judged each other until we didn't have sex for months. And then she moved out without notice. But paid her rent. Then she got the friends in the breakup and I was free to finally move to D.C. as she wasn't holding me back. 
 
 TL;DR: Do it now before you have to get divorced because you married someone you don't know."
355,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The biggest change for me is that now that my girlfriend moved in I have significantly less time to play video games because I'm hanging out with her (she's not a gamer). 
 
 That, and I cook a lot more now. Cooking alone is depressing as fuck IMO"
356,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I lost all my freedom atleast it felt like it
 
 Not bitter about it but it really sunk in when I wanted to enjoy a Saturday off and play some video games and I couldn't cuz she'd start getting fussy, motorcycle solo? Nope. Beer with just the guys? Nope. Life outside her? Nope. She wasn't controlling or anything like that, actually quite normal in comparison to the others I've dated. She Was....Just...Always....There....So I spent alot of effort trying to get away to anywhere but home lol
 
 Anywho, I think she cheated on me, we broke up, grateful cuz it showed me how miserable I was in that relationship. I'm happy now, single going on 2 yrs, back in school and in the greatest shape of my life, enjoying my seemingly endless hobbies and doing whatever the hell I want, when I want. Life is good!
 
 However because of that experience, I'm reluctant to move in with any girl especially from what I see when I look at my friends and their lives living with their SOs. Reminds me of the misery I lived in but companionship is their priority so whatever makes them happy I guess. They do seem sorta jealous of me however haha"
357,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sex became much louder. Although hearing her try to be quiet is pretty fucking hot still.
358,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We got better at getting over arguments. It's easier to argue with someone when you don't have to be around them 24/7.
359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"baby wipes, lotions, Q-tips, wash cloths and other hygiene products. My first serious relationship completely opened my eyes"
360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You get used to the fact that that little philly you're shacking up with can take a mean shit.
361,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He stopped wanting to compromise. He became more angry and shouty. And I felt more alone than when we were doing a 3000 mile long distance relationship. Didn't last long, obviously. Quite the waste of time and money."
362,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,G
363,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,G
364,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We're a lot more gross around each other now. Kinda miss being afraid to fart around her to be honest.
365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know what changes in a girl's mind when she moves in her with boyfriend, but you suddenly have to go to sleep together at the same time every night. I'm a night owl, and my wife will go to bed at nine, expecting me to suddenly be sleepy right then and there. It's nice sleeping together, but going on 4 years of this nonsense is driving me crazy. lol it's all good, though. She fell asleep on the couch around 30 minutes ago (about 10 PM our time) while we were watching A Series of Unfortunate Events."
366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The amount of pussy I get. It is astronomical now.
367,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What changed was I had a place to sleep where I didn't have to worry about getting kicked out of. Her dad is awesome for letting a 15 year old boy move in with him and his 16 year old daughter
368,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can have hugs literally anytime I want, which is the best. If my SO is working late, it doesn't mean I don't get to see him at all, it just means I get my cuddles a little later. We have a lot less sex because I think we felt like we should have sex anytime he stayed over, because we had the opportunity. Now that we know we can have sex literally anytime, we only do it when we really are in in the mood. We cook together more instead of going out or just ordering in rather than fight roommates for kitchen space. We are both messy AF so now neither of us is bothered with living with people with much higher cleaning standards."
369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My relationship status. He proposed the night before we moved in. Otherwise, honestly, not too much. We had done short stints of house sitting and such before to make sure that we could still stand to be around each other if we lived together, so we knew what to adjust so there weren't any major changes."
370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You learn a lot more about each other. Sometimes more than you'd want to know, but it's a good test for the strength of the relationship."
371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have a lot more DVDs, CDs, records, books, and comic books. More than I will ever be able to consume in my lifetime! He has such good taste. We knew it was serious when we started mixing our DVDs and records together on the shelves. 
 
 Also, he helps out so much around the house! I do all the cooking and most of the everyday cleaning. He does laundry, garbage/recycling, basic home maintenance, and the big cleaning jobs. He even does the dishes sometimes! I feel like I have a partner."
372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Getting used to sharing emotions. If you had a great day and your SO comes home from work feeling like shit... guess what, you cant be happy anymore, you have to talk it out, act like an adult and empathize. Even if you were having the greatest day and want to have fun with your wife, you have to switch gears and change moods."
373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Less time to myself/less time with the buds at the bars
374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We kind of moved in almost right away (a few months after meeting) and have been together for almost 6 years.
 
 First thing that changed is that we realized we had different sleeping habits. I'm a night owl who hates mornings and he likes to go to bed around 11/12 and wake up at 7/8 am. We've gotten used to it over the years but it still causes some issues when I'm up on my computer and he gets annoyed."
375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We moved in together after dating for about a year and a half, but I feel like it was a slower transition that it it for most people. I was in school full time and had between two and four part time jobs when we had that apartment, and he was working third shift. It felt more like we were living with each other's stuff than each other. I'd have breakfast while he had dinner, but we still had to actually arrange date nights if we wanted to see each other beyond that. Really, it wasn't too different from just dating other than he didn't have a curfew to meet (my in-laws used to be weirdly strict.) 
 
 That apartment lost heat for the entire coldest winter of our lives, and the property manager made zero effort to correct it. We probably should have sued, but we were kids, so we just moved. We rented out my parents' basement, but the crazy schedules mixed with the lack of privacy made it feel even less like we were living together. 
 
 Now that we're married and have our own place our schedules are a bit more in sync, though not entirely. At this point, though, we're so used to each other that any changes that came about in our relationship due to living together were probably too gradual to notice."
376,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My social life. It's gone. I love her. I just want to hang out with her. My bros miss me and i see them twice a week as aposed to 4 times a week. Life is better though i guess
377,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My life got incredibly easier. He does the stuff I forget to do; laundry, groceries, appliances, etc. I cook, care for our dog, and make sure everything in the house is in order. It's a great compromise we have going. We have a well oiled household and I would hate to image what it would be like without him."
378,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I had to learn to watch out for open cupboards because he NEVER SHUTS THEM!
379,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We had four great years together apart, but after a year together things went sort of sour. We were too common in each others lives. We lasted another decade, and still adore each other today, a year after our breakup, but what used to be an escape from my life became part of my life I couldn't escape."
380,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have noticed how much my boyfriend shaves since we moved in and now see it as more of a weed whacking approach then actual shaving.
381,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coming home to someone every day was so nice. We started dating as teenagers and I moved into his parents house with him. My mom was a single parent who worked long hours so I usually came home to an empty house. Moving in with my boyfriend was a complete change and I would come home after school to a warm house and my boyfriend over the moon to see me
382,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Started holding my farts way to long like unhealthy long, 5 years later I just let it rip under the covers."
383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"She was already super gross before we moved in together. No boundaries no secrets. Although she does seem to fart more. We never have problems with smothering, as we jus talk it out. I do buy the groceries more often but she cleans more so it works out. We were madly in love before and we still are. She finds more beef with the roomies than I do so I try to referee but they're adults and they can figure it out."
384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In my experience our friendship and platonic love deepened. We had a lot more inside jokes and got to know each other more than I had thought possible. On the other hand, I lost all romantic and sexual interest in him and our relationship transformed into something solely platonic. We broke up but are still close friends."
385,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Her being faithful...
386,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We had to completely restructure the way we communicated love. The way our relationship worked before we moved was easy and natural, but once we moved we had to actually consciously communicate love. 5 love languages for the win"
387,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It's hard to live with someone else. Roommates you can leave behind but you love your SO. It's hard to learn to live with others faults.
388,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have really severe ADHD but my girlfriend does not. I basically use her non-disordered daily routine as my own now. 
 
 Before we moved in together, I slept maybe 4 hours a night in average, barely ate or ate like shit when I did, and even had some problems keeping steady with dental hygiene. 
 
 All those problems have vanished now, and it's amazing how much more functional you become once small things like that aren't a problem anymore."
389,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My quality of sleep. He snorts and grunts and tosses and turns...and I lay fuming. Ive been married a long time, and one of the biggest reasons it has lasted is that we mutually decided to sleep in separate rooms. We are so much cheerier and loving with each other when we are rested. He's a real nice guy."
390,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not being able to skip buying groceries occasionally because there's a book or ten I'm really wanting. I can live perfectly fine skipping meals. My husband, however, eats three meals a day."
391,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Less sex and more fighting. Bad idea...
392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I literally cannot recall. The 2 babies we have had since have left everything prior incredibly foggy. But I can tell you this, the present is beautiful."
393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We were too close that we grew further apart. 
 I took her in after she was evicted. 
 It was supposed to be for a month or less and it ended up being for a year. 
 I made her move out because I found out she felt something for another man. 
 We were only together for 4 years but that was our downfall.
 Never move in with someone you're not ready to move in with. 
 We fell out of love."
394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When we finally moved in together, I was able to ditch my crazy, petty roommate. I had needed a roommate quickly and he was a friend of a friend, so how bad could it be, right? Ugh.
 
 Roommate stole money and food from me, stole toilet paper from his workplace when he didn't want to pay for his share of it (he used a *lot,* like a roll a day somehow, so buying it was getting expensive and he didn't want to contribute)... It wasn't all petty, either. He decided which of my two cats was his favorite and then put my other cat outside to get lost (safely gotten back three hours later-- a neighbor took him in and called me, and both were already microchipped); kept hiding both cats' collars for some reason; repeatedly smoked all over the place inside, contributing to several asthma attacks for me; would rant at great length about how Hillary Clinton was the actual, literal antichrist, Obama was the devil, and how they both had their own *personal* nukes (he never specified where) and that they'd end up leading the world to a holocaust; and at the very end, he kept the entire refunded deposit from the landlady (some $700), which I had paid in the first place without ever being paid back.
 
 Anyway, the guy was batshit fucking crazy. I moved out a month before the end of the lease, the day SO and I signed our new lease together, four years ago. Best decision I've made! SO (now fiancé) is wonderful, doesn't believe crazy conspiracy theories, and pays for his share of the toilet paper. My cats love him more than me, but he's never chucked any of them out of the windows, fed them unsafe foods, or tried to get them drunk. He even pees *in* the toilet instead of just *near* it, too!"
395,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"People present their best version of themselves. Once you live together, you see the real them. Does she cry when she has a bad day? Only one way to find out. 
 
 Otherwise, as stated above."
396,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I learned that women can be messier than men.
397,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Depends on the couple, but we were both very busy students/ workers who long termed study abroads, living 2 hrs away for a year, then 3.5 hours away for 6 months until getting married. We both had alone time activities to recharge. It was weird just having someone there all the time."
398,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No need to plan sexy times anymore. either of us could just roll over and be like ""NOW.""
 
 Pretty good feeling."
399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I figured out all the bad habits he'd been hiding, he found out I wasnt gonna put up with bullshit and we fell out of love in less than a month."
400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not me, but my friend got married. I spend the night all the time and now I wake up woth blankets on me often. Place is cleaner now too. 
 
 However every single time i eat anything there, even out of package chips i get one long blonde hair in my mouth."
401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I lived with my gf of 4 years in a townhouse agreement and she and I shared a room and house with other people.
 
 When we were in different houses she was never really touchy or cuddly but when we moved in she liked to be held a lot. I remember it being some innocent thing too, not anything g sexual she would just drape my arm over her in bed or on her waist.
 
 She got super cuddly and affectionate which was super good to come home to from work"
402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We try more things that the other enjoys. I really enjoy cooking so every weekend we try a new recipe together and cook together. He is really into soccer, so we will wake up and watch games together on the weekend and talk about stats and news in the soccer world. We also get to really support what the other one wants to do, like help turn the garage into a workshop for him or he will help push me out the door to the gym. There are so many others that one of us has gotten the other into, we work opposite shifts during the week so when we get our weekends together we really get to enjoy things together. Also Reddit was one of his things he was obsessed with that he got me into!"
403,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sleep. He snores so loud, it was a real adjustment. Now, 8 years later, it's hard to sleep without that next to me."
404,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I live a lot cleaner now.
405,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Can't play video games as often as I want and not enough me time !
406,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I eat better. Better food that's better for me.
407,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,More farts.
408,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sleeping habits. My girlfriend would fall asleep, no joke, by 8:30 every night. I on the other hand have extremely irresponsible habits and usually stay up until 4 or 5 AM. I no longer do that. We have somewhat compromised and usually fall asleep closer to 11 or 12 now."
409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I used to tidy up when I wanted to. Now, if I'm sitting and watching tv or playing the Xbox and she starts to tidy up i feel obliged to join in."
410,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I never knew how bad of a sleeper I was until we started sleeping in the same bed. I've always known I had a few problems but when he started calling me a little lawn mower I began to get it. I snore...a ton. I've always enjoyed snoring cause then I know it's a good sleep. But now I feel bad cause it wakes him up. He thinks it's cute. I also get sooooooo much more sleep with him. I didn't think I had insomnia until we shared a bed. I would stay awake for hours and then sleep for 45 mins when I'm by myself. Something about hearing him at night makes me sleep better and if I wake up restless at night then a quick walk to pee and sip on water and I'm much better. I also dream more and in general am happier. It's amazing what sleep and comfort will do to your over all well being.
 
 Basically I'm a terrible sleeper and did know it till we started sleeping in the same bed."
411,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We stopped fucking
412,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,i don't drink coffee so i've had to get used to coffee grounds all over the kitchen.
413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The decor
414,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I've lived with my boyfriend for 2 years now.
 
 We've become waaay too comfortable with each others bodily functions. We were already pretty comfortable to begin with but way more so now. The nice part is we're both still just as attracted to each other despite all of that lol
 
 Also being apart is harder, especially sleeping apart. It's so uncomfortable and wrong feeling to sleep alone. Even just having to go separate ways for Christmas was hard af. It was so rough, we decided next year it's time we started doing holidays together and alternating families. One of my weirdest ""wow I'm truly an adult now..."" moments"
415,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Went to go to bed one night, and out of the darkness, I'm shot with a Nerf gun. Turns out she bought one just to ambush me with. I don't know where it when it'll happen next, but I will most certainly be ambushed again,"
416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Discovered that he has IED and is prone to fits of rage and smashing things. It's gotten to be quite the expense.
417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You start to realize if you really love the person or not and when you know the answer life begins to take on a new meaning.
418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My bank account got empty real fast
419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I work 44 hours a week, and cant spend any of it. At least i have money in my bank."
420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I was very skeptical about moving in at first. I wasn't sure we were ready and although we got along very well, you never know until you live together.
 
 It's been 6 months and surprisingly we've gotten along very well, most likely due to clear and honest communication. If something bothers the other, (him leaving his clothes around or me not cleaning up my hair) we tell the other, and the other works to improve it. It's been the best 6 months of my life. 
 
 And yes it's all true - the farts, the hair everywhere, the sloppiness, and the intolerance of being apart from each other for too long."
421,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bras. Bras everywhere.
422,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Before him, I lived with a friend of mine, and she was cleaner than me. I'm kind of a lazy slob, to be honest. But my boyfriend is even more of a slob than I am. So things are messier. I'm hoping to really clean and organize the apartment this weekend because as it turns out, slob though I am, I like clean places. 
 
 Also ffs, honey, emptying the dishwasher includes putting the dishes that were in the sink in the dishwasher. I understand the pile of dirty dishes is fucking gross, but seriously. I see you low-key avoiding that chore, bun. >.> 
 
 ...then again I'm the same with folding clothes so there's that."
423,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot more sex! To be fair, we didn't move in till we were married and didn't have sex till we were married. But man going from nothing to anything in the sex department was awesome! That and hair EVERYWHERE"
424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stopped having to fly 6 hours every weekend.
425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The layout of my room.
 
 Good thing it was only rearranged that way for 2 months, huh?"
426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Twice as many farts in bed.
427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We've been together for about 3 1/2 years now and I moved in after about a year together, which was pretty much us getting right out of high school. 
 
 The most difficult part would be whenever we fight, it's hard to get the breathing space we each need to calm down without misinterpreting things. Aside from that, we're pretty similar with our habits. It's hard to end days without him now though, even harder to go on trips without him to accompany me."
428,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I hate everything about it.
429,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have a second mom... That's what I found out damn it. Everything is do this do that you can't do this. I now have learned I will always have someone telling me what to do in my house :(
430,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sex changed for the worse for us. I actually just realized it recently. We still had sex, and it was great, but the romance was gone. Instead of sweet nothings and flirting, it was just one of us saying, ""hey, wanna have sex tonight? "" Since I started being a little more romantic again, things have been great."
431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Her last name.
432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,She developed alcoholism
433,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My fucking water bill doubled 😡
434,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I finally came to the conclusion that the reason I'm so flaky and constantly cancel plans is because I like being alone. Not all of the time, but a lot. The problem was I bought into society's notion that in order to be somebody, I had to be recognized by someone else. As soon as I was married, I finally realized that I constantly have someone around to do stuff with and I can choose to be alone, when I want and actually enjoy the other person's company and it's become more selfless, my time spent with others."
435,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is all so weird because my SO and I were roomates that started dating a couple months in the lease.... I guess of you know you can live with them you can sure as hell date them
436,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I gained 50 pounds. She likes food. And I was more of a eat once a day when it crossed my mind kind of guy. 
 
 I've since lost the weight I put on though. And were married now. XD"
437,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I started ""losing"" things. She calls it tidying, I call it bullshit."
438,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Well I've been with my SO for about 12 yrs. The biggest changes are honestly realizing how much you can affect someone at any moment of the day. You learn how important compromise is. And also that your farts aren't as funny as you think. Everything changes. There's no getting around it. You will change a little here and there to make her happy and she will do the same. When we are young we have this grand plan for what we think it will be like to live with someone we love. If the romantic notion is still in your head you're in for a rude awakening. You will fight more and learn to lose with age. Just don't ever go to bed angry, and never raise your fist to someone you love. Realize that you are both human and capable of terrible mistakes, and wonderful achievements. You will love each other with all your heart one day and wonder how you ever were interested in them the next. Keep the good memories in your mind as much as you can and let the bad ones fade away. Basically you're screwed..."
439,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There were bras hanging on my door knobs, the inventory of pajamas in the household went up by a magnitude of 5 , I had to 3-4 times the amount of laundry to do and there was always dirty dishes in the sink. Also I watched a lifetimes worth of reality tv."
440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He's constantly hiding behind doors and trying to surprise me at every opportunity. Goodbye peace
441,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Any time you need to take a shit real bad, she's in the bathroom already"
442,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"She's picky about how I raise my kids. She's probably right and I'm probably wrong, but I'm the dad and dad is rarely right...according to mom or moms as a rule in the U.S."
443,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,we broke up
444,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I have not slept the same since, most everything else about our relationship has gotten even better!!"
445,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I want a SO.... :( Do work husbands count?
446,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's no longer ""your home"""
447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"At first, stomacheaches for weeks (holding in farts), today it seems we fart the whole freaking day."
448,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My fiance learned fast how to deal with my rather volatile temper after he wouldn't drop an argument to the point I was in tears and I lost my head. I threw a dog gate at him. Luckily, I realized that I could have really hurt him and swerved so it flew past him. I stormed off and locked myself in the bedroom but after like 5 hours, he gently knocked and asked me if I wanted soup. We've been together for 15 years, since we were 13. The gate story is pretty infamous now and soup is our go-to apology."
449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No privacy, ever."
450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tastes in foods. He's learning to eat more gluten-free good because it's inconvenience, and I'm learning how to cook meat and cook it well. I'm also surprised at how I much I love cooking now. Before him, it was just to get a healthy, cost-effective meal but now I feel like I'm in a competition where we constantly have to out-do the other's food. He wins in meats, I win in everything else."
451,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This is going to sound terrible, but I actually began to mean it when I told her I loved her. I guess I wasn't really sure who she was for real until we started living together. I wasn't sure if I actually wanted to be with her or not. Now I don't even question it."
452,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"She's a using cunt and sponges off me, now she won't leave"
453,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The frequency of sex. We did it more often, and are still doing it as much as when we first started living together."
454,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I used to sleep right in the middle of my own bed, sprawled out. Now I sleep on my side. That's about it. Oh, we ""carpool"" now."
455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I make my bed now.
456,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The first two weeks we lived together alone we fought. Every. Single. Night. I say lived together alone because we'd lived together with another couple for a year before we got our own place. The biggest change is that we run around the apartment in our underwear a lot and the house is much messier than when we had roommates. Also there's not really a distinction anymore between community space and private space like there is when you have roommates. All our shit is just everywhere and we like it that way. Most of the time.
457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We broke up
458,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"IT was great for a long time, then some issues came up and we are still trying to get back on our feet."
459,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can't binge play video games anymore. Not only because she's home most of the time and (more often than not) won't have any of it, but also the internet in my country is shit so no multiplayer at all unless she's at work.
 
 Those 2 or 3 hours on weekends are glorious tho. But then she comes home, and it's a different kind of happy... If you know what I mean."
460,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The amount of Star Wars merch in my house went down significantly...
461,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I stopped listening to the music I like. I use to listen to music all evening once I got in from work. I'd order loads of new albums each week and just sit and read whilst playing them.
 
 Unfortunately my wife doesn't like the same sort of music as I do (we have a few bands we both like) so I stopped doing it. It didn't feel right to carry on as I did when I was with someone else and it just stopped.
 
 Kinda bitter about this. It's now hard to make time for the music I like. I can't listen at work or during my commute. I don't have a lot of time at home to myself."
462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I moved in with my now husband when our baby was three months old ( got drunk too much, got pregnant, decided to give it a go), onto a flat, with roommates. So living with him, and other people. Letting him take care of the baby his way and knowing she would be OK."
463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Couldn't tell ya, I moved in with her after 2 weeks. That was 4.5 years ago."
464,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We fart more.
465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I keep the place more clean than I used to. I've begun learning how to cook and I enjoy it. We no longer close the bathroom door haha.
466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The ticking of the break up clock.
467,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For me it is being in a terrible mood. It doesn't matter what kind of bad mood or what caused it, or if there even was a cause, we always talk about it. If someone wakes up in a bad mood or has a bad day we go out of the way to make each other feel better."
468,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I never thought I'd see Stereo-lab skateboards hanging on my dining room walls, next to my 1920's dining set.
 
 
 Also, how can someone survive on cheez-its & cheerios?"
469,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Weirdly, we started getting on much better than we ever had and fell even more in love. We'd both had live-in relationships before that hadn't ended well, so I suppose we both saw the importance of cooperation and helping each other out"
470,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I do all the cooking, when we didn't live together we ate out or she ordered take away"
471,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Honestly not much for us. Its important to understand its going to be different for everyone. For us we just saved a lot of money on rent and saw more of each other.
472,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He thought he didn't like my cats, but then realized he loved my cats.
 
 And then he sympathized with me about goats being fucking stupid."
473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The basement. We had to fix a flood based in grey water & remodeled a 50 year old design.
474,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We broke up.
475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Learning not to be a nudist.
476,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I've never moved in with any SOs but my ex used to sleep with the light on her phone whenever she spent an inordinate amount of time at my flat. Despite being surrounded by tech I never have any light visible from the bed so I had to help her get over her fear of the dark so I could sleep easily. Didn't help she hated me covering my head for bizarre reasons. Nothing to do with why we broke up
477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We can use each other's stuff! At first I was hesitant to hop on his desktop or eat his food but eventually everything became *ours*. Now I don't hesitate to use some of his shampoo if I run out of mine, or borrow (keep) his jacket, or drink one of his beers. I've even contemplated wearing his socks."
478,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It took awhile, but there was a learning curve for household expectations, especially when we were both working. Chores couldn't just be done by one person, and both people had to do their best to help and make things easier for the other person."
479,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,She became messy.
480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"FREEEEEDOM!
 
 Sorta.
 
 Basically u have to make decisions that fit both of you, rather than just planning mainly for yourself.
 
 You also become the center of each other's lives because u spend more time together and your relationship deepens, which means u have to let go of some things U previously had time or the freedom for."
481,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Candle's. Frickin candle's everywhere.
482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I suddenly had a cat.
483,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I lost weight because all the big meals I would prepare have someone else to share the leftovers with. 
 
 I'd have been eating the same food for like a week at a time before. I definitely appreciate having more variety, even if it means spending more time in the kitchen."
484,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I can poop whenever I want. My stomach thanks her for moving in.
485,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Less farting in bed.
486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I always have to initiate sex now. She's down for it most anytime but I have to initiate.
487,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There are two certain pillows..........""decorative"" they're called. One smooth side, on side entirely covered in round metal flowers. These pillows get ""lost"" every few days."
488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It turns out girls do fart
489,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"At first it was very similar to when we were dating - but after 25 years of marriage...a bit of legal proceedings, and the results of sexually transmitted contact I now have 6 parasites that take all of my time, sanity, and money"
490,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I never realized that all my furniture was ""junky looking"" and that it deserved to be in the basement.
 
 granted it was man fabulous but it was in near mint condition. Just not child friendly...lots of glass tables. I went from a place that was very me to a place that was very....not me."

492,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hair....long hair everywhere.
493,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sleep. My queen bed got crowded, her plus our dog (only 30 pounds but she stretches). GF moves around a lot too, wakes me up occasionally. She sleeps like a rock, lucky."
494,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I started eating better.
495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Can't run around the house flailing my arms yelling ""WOOP WOOP WOOP"" at almost top-volume (neighbors) without feeling self-conscious.
 
 And the bed being 1/3 mine 2/3 hers thing is real."
496,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My lack of privacy. It's not bad, but sometimes I love it when he says ""I'm going to take a nap.""
 
 I know he feels the same way, lol."
497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I realized that a woman actually farts. And sometimes, it's loud and stinky."
498,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I can no longer chill for a sec, playing games is out of the question. If I'm not working I'm supposed to be sitting next to her watching some say yes to the dress shit on TLC while she chats with her sister on her phone because we need time 'together'.
 
 Also I find that I'm much more inclined to stay up late into the night even if I still have to get up at 6am"
499,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I found out that women do in fact, poop just like us. :( The secrets been broken."
500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He tidies up way less. When we didn't live together and he was at mine he would always tidy up before going to bed. Then I moved in with him and realised he really isn't that tidy.
501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(Not together anymore, but felt like posting)
 
 I didn't know where to put my shampoo/bodywash anymore. For a few months it just sat on the floor till I just threw out her almost empty bottles of stuff."
502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I can never find anything
503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I eat a lot more veggies and I change the sheets every week, which is quite the change from before."
504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hehehe
505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Farts. So many farts.
506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Socka. Dirty socks are left EVERYWHERE.
507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'm so excited to experience all of this
508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I think things went both good and bad. We see each other more but we argue more from result.
509,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I became more relaxed and realised stuff could occasionally wait for tomorrow. I used to be a massive neat freak but since then it has now just come down to a generally tidy person.
510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I began sleeping naked. I never did before. I mean, when we first started dating, we fucked almost constantly. 8-9 times a day. Getting clothes on just seemed, like, uncecessary if the first thing we're going to do is wake up and fuck. Now, since we're married and we are down to 1 or 2 times a day and I still strip down to nothing. It is preferred. I remember doing that at an airbnb and she was like ""YOU CAN'T DO THAT AT SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE!""."
511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Just don't.
512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,They eventually leave.
513,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He would never hurt me or our newborn but when he gets upset at something he can be scary.
514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pro: I eat much better and healthier. 
 Con: Grocery bill is through the roof."
515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nothing, I still do what I want when I want because I'm a MAN."
516,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have never touched the remote control since 😂
517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Her anus. It became hairy and turned a dark brown.
518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Well, I haven't been right about anything since then, so there's that."
519,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It becomes more difficult to hide the bodies
520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"what changed is I no longer had to live with roommates, and there's nothing better than that. also it's the best thing ever. also interesting to hear about all these quiet husbands, i've been living with mine for almost 8 years and we can go on and on talking for hours, as long as we're angry/frustrated about something happening in the world (not hard to find something wrong in the world rn). or if there's good chisme about family/friends. that's also a good topic."
521,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,His bedtime- it went from 2 am to midnight. I'm now open to eating icecream in bed.
522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don´t have an SO right now, but my neighbor just came back now when Christmas is over, and it took about one day before i found her hair around my dick, and this is happening with quite a few of my female friends as well, its almost like my dick attracts parts of them."
